This paper models how transfers, a tax rate on labor income, and  the distribution of government debt should
respond to aggregate shocks when markets are incomplete. A planner sets a lump sum transfer and a linear tax on labor income
in an economy with heterogeneous agents, aggregate uncertainty, and a single asset with a possibly risky payoff. Limits to redistribution coming from incomplete  tax instruments and limits to hedging coming from incomplete  asset markets affect optimal policies.
Two forces shape long-run outcomes: the planner's desire to minimize the welfare cost of fluctuating transfers, which calls for a negative correlation between
agents' assets and their skills; and the planner's desire to use fluctuations in
the return on the traded asset to compensate for missing state-contingent securities.  In a multi-agent model calibrated to match facts about  US booms and recessions,
the planner's preferences about distribution  make  policies over business cycle frequencies  differ markedly from
Ramsey plans for representative agent  models.

\section{Introduction}
\color{black}
What are the welfare costs of public debt? What determines whether and how quickly a government should retire its debt? How should  tax rates, transfers, and government debt respond to aggregate shocks? We study how answers to these questions depend on a government's desire and ability to redistribute
and to hedge fluctuations in deficits.

We restrict tax collections to be   affine functions of labor income. Agents differ in
their productivities and wealth.  They  trade a single  security whose payoff possibly depends on aggregate shocks.
A Ramsey planner attaches  a  vector of Pareto weights to different types of agents' discounted utilities and adjusts
the proportional labor  tax rate, transfers, and asset purchases in response to aggregate shocks. A distribution of assets  gives rise to  flows of asset earnings across  agents that depend on how returns on the asset comove with aggregate shocks. These
  flows require the government  to adjust labor taxes and transfers  to achieve its distributive and financing goals. Labor taxes distort  labor supplies, but fluctuations in  transfers also lower welfare. A decrease in transfers in response to adverse aggregate shocks  affects agents who have low present values of earnings especially.

%\textbf{Tom: reworked material starts here.}
%
%
%This paper disentangles  contending forces that arise from limits to redistribution and incompleteness of markets by  first building up analytical results in a simplified setup with quasilinear preferences.   We  validate findings from that simple
%setup in a more general quantitative model calibrated to US data.

Section \ref{Sec: environment} sets out  preferences and possibilities that define the economic environment.
Section \ref{sec:Ricardian101}
describes a  Ricardian property for our environment that we subsequently exploit in concisely formulating the Ramsey problem
in section \ref{sec: Ramsey Plan}.
Net asset positions, by which we mean assets of individuals minus assets of some benchmark agent affect the set of allocations that can be implemented
in competitive equilibria with a proportional labor tax and transfers.
This insight reduces the dimension of the state needed to characterize a Ramsey plan recursively. It also justifies a normalization that allows us to interpret government debt and transfers separately. We do this by setting asset holdings of the least productive agent to be zero, and back out transfers as a gap between the consumption and after tax labor income of this agent. 



A Ramsey plan induces an ergodic distribution of transfers,   the labor tax rate, and the distribution of assets that is
%that we shall describe in sections \ref{Sec: environment} quasilinear} and \ref{Sec: more general economies}.
%The ergodic joint distribution is
  determined by interactions between
a) the government's  ability to hedge aggregate shocks by taking advantage of fluctuations in  the return on the asset it trades;
and b) the government's preferences about  redistribution that affect how costly it is to, alternatively, use fluctuations in transfers to hedge these shocks.
The analysis in sections \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, \ref{Sec: more general economies}, and \ref{sec: numerical results}
shows that these interactions  shape  the ergodic distribution of government debt in the following ways.
If equilibrium outcomes make the  return on the asset {\em low} when the net-of interest government deficit is high,
then the government will  run up  debt.  %; if the return on the asset is low, the government accumulates debt and in the other case when returns on the asset are high, it accumulates assets.
But if the return on the asset is {\em high} when the net-of-interest government deficit is high, the
 government will accumulate assets.
  The long run variances of government assets and the tax rate are both lower and  rates of convergence to the ergodic distribution are
higher in economies in which the comovement between the net-of interest deficit and  the return on  the asset is bigger in absolute magnitude.
 Other things equal, governments that want more redistribution eventually hold fewer assets.

The comovement between the aggregate shock that drives government expenditures and returns
on the single asset is a key intermediating object that shapes the ergodic joint distribution of the tax rate and government debt.  In our general setting, one-period utilities are concave in consumption. That makes  the return on the single asset an equilibrium object partly under the control of the Ramsey planner.
%that the Ramsey planner partly chooses by choosing an allocation subject to implementability constraints that confine it to choosing among
%competitive equilibrium with transfers and distorting taxes.
 To help us understand forces shaping both the ergodic joint distribution and rates of convergence to it,  we begin by
studying a special setting in which returns on the single asset and their correlation with the aggregate shock are exogenous, namely,
a setting with one-period utilities  that are quasilinear, meaning linear in consumption.
%\color{black}XXXXX Check if the previous sentence is still confusing.\color{black}
%\textbf{Tom XXXXX: move the following paragraph or change it -- move to preceding section at the end.}
Section \ref{Sec: quasilinear} executes this quasilinear  analysis in two parts. We begin by analyzing
a representative agent economy with quasilinear preferences, a government restricted to set transfers equal to zero always, and i.i.d aggregate shocks to public expenditures.
  Our main finding here is  that for a large class of payoff structures,
debt  drifts towards an ergodic set that in a sense maximizes the  government's ability to hedge expenditure shocks,  a set
that  primarily depends on how the payoff on the asset  correlate with  fluctuations in the
 government's net-of-interest deficit. 
 %In particular, if the  payoff  is  high when the government
 %needs revenue to finance a higher net-of-interest deficit, optimal hedging requires the government to issue positive debt, and, conversely, if the
  %asset payoff is low in such times, the government would want to hold positive assets.
   %The magnitude of debt (or assets) is decreasing and the speed at which the debt converges is increasing in the magnitude of this comovement.
For special cases in which the asset payoff is affine in government expenditure shocks, we
show that the ergodic distribution is degenerate. For other assumptions about the asset payoff, shock correlation, we develop tools to approximate the ergodic distribution
 and tell  how the spread of the ergodic distribution of government  debt and the tax rate increases with how far the payoffs  are from allowing perfect fiscal hedging.

 The representative agent analysis with transfers restricted to zero
  turns out to be   informative about what is going on in multiple agent economies with no restrictions on transfers but with Pareto weights that make
     the welfare  costs of transfers so  high that the Ramsey planner chooses never to use them, or at least not to use them
     eventually.\footnote{The analysis
also  augments what is known about representative agent economies in which a single  risk-free bond is traded (e.g., \citet{Aiyagari2002}, \citet{Farhi2010},
and \citet{Faraglia2011}).}
This conclusion is established by analyzing an economy with  unrestricted transfers, and two types of agents both of whom
 have quasilinear one-period utilities and one of whom is not productive. We study the effects of the presence or absence of  a nonnegativity constraint on the consumption of the unproductive agent as a determinant of the asymptotic level of government debt and  whether and when transfers are used.
%and then analyzes  how concerns for redistribution matter when transfers are unrestricted and there ar
The asymptotic level of assets is decreasing in the planner's desire for redistribution.
This comes from the fact that welfare costs of using transfers are lower for a more redistributive government.
Consequently it relies more on transfers and has less cause to accumulate assets to hedge aggregate shocks.



%
%
%To illuminate these features, we use the following strategy. In section \ref{Sec: quasilinear},  we begin by studying
%a simplified  economy with quasilinear household preferences and i.i.d aggregate shocks. This setting lets us
% isolate the  forces that drive the outcomes summarized in the preceding paragraph.
%

 In section \ref{Sec: more general economies},
we study economies that are more general in terms of their  heterogeneity, preferences, and shock structures.  We formulate the Ramsey problem recursively in terms of two Bellman equation,
one for time $0$ and another for times $t\geq 1$.  That these Bellman equations have different state variables expresses the time inconsistency
of our Ramsey plans, which as usual attribute to the time $0$ Ramsey planner the ability to commit to an intertemporal plan.
Subsections \ref{sec:2complete} and \ref{sec: 2 agent example}   derive conditions under which the planner can eventually
achieve complete hedging, i.e., both constant labor tax rate and consumption shares even when the return on the asset is endogenous.

%\textbf{Tom  HHHHHH: mention approx method here -- maybe later.}
%Subsection \ref{sec:stability} analyzes  a more general set of economies  with iid binary shocks \textbf{Anmol XXXXX: let's fill in here the sense in which
%it is more general again -- e.g., shock process or utilities or number of types of agents.}
%by applying an  extension of  the same type of approximation method used earlier in section \ref{Sec: rep agent}.
 %also used in Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}  approximation method.


In section \ref{sec: numerical results},
we numerically verify that the forces isolated in the more analytically tractable  models of sections \ref{Sec: quasilinear}
  and \ref{Sec: more general economies} extend to a version of the model with several types of agents  calibrated to match US data.
%These insights extend to economies with preferences having curvature in the utilities from consumption. 
We calibrate a version of our model to US data that captures (1) the initial heterogeneity wages and assets;
(2) the observation  that  in recessions the left tail of the cross-section distribution of labor income falls by more than right tail; and (3) how inflation and asset return risk comove with labor productivity. 
We use this model to validate and quantify the importance of the channels  emphasized in our theoretical analysis of simpler environments. Besides this we also describe features of optimal government policy, especially in booms and recessions at higher frequencies.
During recessions accompanied by higher inequality, it is  optimal to increase taxes and transfers and to issue
government debt. %If the  government starts with sufficiently high  initial debt, no noticable trend in debt repayment.
These outcomes differ both qualitatively and quantitatively from those in either a representative agent model or in a version
of our model in which a  recession is modelled as a pure TFP shock that leaves the distribution of skills unchanged.


We obtain our main results using two methodological contributions, which we believe will be useful in our settings as well. First, for the quasilinear preferences studied in section \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, we obtain sharp characterizations of the ergodic distribution of debt and taxes by approximating transition dynamics around economies that permit perfect fiscal hedging. This approach also enabled a local stability analysis for economies with the more general preferences of section \ref{sec:stability}. Second, quantitative applications as ambitious as those in our section \ref{sec: numerical results} are made possible by taking a sequence of polynomial approximations about steady states of a sequence of deterministic economies and evaluating the
polynomials at a current distribution of idiosyncratic state variables of the incomplete markets economy. This approach allows us to study transition paths of the optimal allocation that express the dynamics of the joint distribution of individual wealths and past consumptions, a high dimension endogenous state vector. Both of these contributions build on ideas developed in \cite{Evans2014} 


Section \ref{sec:concluding} offers concluding remarks.  


%In this paper, we have adhered to the adage that technique should  efface itself in the service of economic analysis. 
%Nevertheless, it is appropriate to mention that we have attained the main results in this paper only by taking advantage of 
%important technical improvements developed during our work on this paper. Two types  of contributions are interesting in their own right
%because they will surely be useful in other settings. They are distinct applications of a new approach of \cite{Evans2014} that involves computing 
%approximations of dynamic  heterogeneous agent incomplete market economies about steady states of carefully chosen {\em other} economies.

\subsection{Relationships to literatures}
\textbf{Anmol and Mike: this subsection has just been cut and pasted from a long ago version. I don't like literature review sections, but
I think we need one for strategic reasons if only to help an editor get us fair referees.}

Our paper extends both \citet{Barro1974}, which showed Ricardian equivalence in a representative agent economy with lump sum taxes,
and \citet{Barro1979}, which studied  optimal taxation  when lump sum taxes are ruled out. In our environment with incomplete markets and heterogeneous workers,
both forces discovered by Barro play large roles.  But the distributive motives that we include alter optimal policies.

 A large  literature on Ramsey problems  exogenously restricts transfers in the context of representative agent, general equilibrium models.
  \citet{LucasJr.1983}, \citet{Chari1994},  and \citet{Aiyagari2002} (henceforth called  AMSS)
 %\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: let's decide on whether or not
 % we actually do this.}  are leading  examples.
 Figure \ref{fig:affine_taxes} shows that an affine structure better approximates the US tax-transfer system than just proportional labor taxes. {
  \begin{figure}

  \end{figure}

}
% \textbf{Anmol XXXXXX: the ``Golosov graph'' could go about here don't you think?}
In contrast to those papers, our Ramsey planner cares about the distribution of welfare among
agents with different skills and wealths. Except for  not allowing them to depend
on agents' personal identities, we leave   transfers unrestricted and let  the Ramsey planner set
them optimally. We find that  some of the same general principles that emerge from the
representative agent, no-transfers literature continue to hold, in particular, the prescription to
smooth distortions across time and states.  However, it is also true that
allowing the government to set transfers optimally changes
the optimal policy in important
respects.\footnote{A distinct strand of literature focuses on  optimal policy in settings with
heterogeneous agents when a government can impose arbitrary taxes subject only
to explicit informational constraints (see \citet{golosov2007new} for a review). A striking result from that literature
is that when  agent's asset holdings are perfectly observable, the distribution of assets among
agents is irrelevant and an optimal allocation can be achieved purely through
taxation (see, e.g. \citet{Bassetto2004}).  In the previous version of the paper we showed that a mechanism design version of the model with unobservable assets generates some of the similar predictions to the model with affine taxes that we study, in particular, the relevance of net assets and history dependence of taxes. We leave further analysis along this
direction to the  future.}

Several other papers impute distributive concerns to a Ramsey planner.
Three papers  most closely related to ours are \citet{Bassetto1999}, \citet{shin2006ramsey}, and \citet{Wer07a}. Like us, those authors allow heterogeneity and study
distributional consequences of alternative tax and borrowing policies.
\citet{Bassetto1999} extends the \citet{LucasJr.1983} environment to include $N$ types of
agents with heterogeneous  time-invariant labor productivities. There are complete markets.  The Ramsey planner  has access only
to proportional taxes on labor income and state-contingent borrowing. \citeauthor{Bassetto1999}  studies how the Ramsey planner's vector of Pareto weights
influences how he responds to government expenditures and other shocks by
adjusting the proportional labor tax and government borrowing to cover
expenses while manipulating competitive equilibrium prices to redistribute wealth between
 `rentiers' (who have low productivities and  whose main income is from their asset holdings)
and  `workers' (who have high productivities) whose main income source is their labor.

\citet{shin2006ramsey} extends the AMSS  (\citet{Aiyagari2002}) incomplete markets economy to  two risk-averse households who
face idiosyncratic income risk. When idiosyncratic income risk is big enough
relative to government expenditure risk, the Ramsey planner
chooses to issue debt so that  households can  engage in precautionary
saving, thereby overturning the AMSS result that  a
 Ramsey planner  eventually sets taxes to zero and lives off its earnings from assets thereafter.
  Shin emphasizes that the
government does this at the cost of imposing tax distortions.
Constrained to use proportional labor income taxes and nonnegative
transfers, Shin's Ramsey planner balances two competing self-insurance
motives: aggregate tax smoothing and individual consumption smoothing.

\citet{Wer07a} studies a complete markets economy with heterogeneous agents
and transfers that are unrestricted in sign. He obtains counterparts to our Ricardian
results about net versus gross asset positions, including the legitimacy of a normalization allowing government
assets to be set to zero in all periods. Because he allows unrestricted
taxation of initial assets, the initial distribution of assets plays no
role. Our theorem \ref{theorem: main} and corollary \ref{corr: B does not matter}
generalize Werning's results by showing that all allocations of assets among
agents and the government that imply the same net asset position
lead to the same optimal allocation, a conclusion that holds for market
structures beyond the complete markets structure analyzed by \citeauthor{Wer07a}.
  \citet{Wer07a} provides an extensive
characterization of optimal allocations and distortions in complete market
economies, while we focus on precautionary savings motives for private
agents and the government that are absent when markets are complete.\footnote{%
\cite{Werning2012} studies optimal taxation with incomplete markets and explores
conditions under which optimal taxes depend only on the aggregate state.}$^,$\footnote{%
More recent closely related papers are \citet{Azzimonti2008,Azzimonti2008a} and \citet{Correia2010}. While these authors study optimal policy in
 economies in which agents are heterogeneous in skills and initial assets, they
  do not allow aggregate shocks.}

  Finally, our numerical analysis in Section \ref{sec: numerical results} is related to \citet{mckay2013}. While our focus differs from theirs -- McKay and Reis study the effect of a  calibrated version of the US tax and transfer system on stabilization of output, while we focus on optimal policy  in a  simpler economy -- both papers confirm the importance of transfers and redistribution over business-cycle frequencies.

\section{Environment}
\label{Sec: environment}

Exogenous fundamentals include a stochastic
cross section of skills $\{\theta_{i,t}\}_{i,t}$, government expenditures $g_t$,  and the payoff $p_t$ on an asset.
These  are all functions of a shock $s_{t}\in S$
governed by an irreducible Markov process that takes values in $S$, a finite set.
We let $s^{t}=\left(s_{0},...,s_{t}\right)$
denote a history of shocks having joint probability
 density $\pi(s^t)$.\footnote{To save on notation, mostly we use $z_{t}$ to denote a random variable
with a time $t$ conditional distribution that is a function of the
history $s^{t}$. Occasionally, we use the more explicit notion $z\left(s^{t}\right)$
to denote a realization at a particular history $s^{t}.$}

There is a mass $n_{i}$ of type $i\in I$ agents, with $\sum_{i=1}^{I}n_{i}=1.$
Types differ in skills indexed by $\{\theta_{i,t}\}_{i,t}$.
Preferences of an agent of type $i$ over stochastic processes for consumption $\{c_{i,t}\}_{t}$ and labor supply $\{l_{i,t}\}_{t}$
are ordered by
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}U^{i}\left(c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right),\label{utility lifetime}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbb{E}_{t}$ is a mathematical expectations operator conditioned on time $t$ information and
$\beta\in\left(0,1\right)$ is a time discount factor.
Except in sections  \ref{sec:Ricardian101} and \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, we assume that $U^{i}:\mathbb{R}%
_{+}^{2}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is concave in $\left( c,-l\right) $ and
twice continuously differentiable. We let $U_{x,t}^{i}\ $or $U_{xy,t}^{i}$
denote first and second derivatives of $U^{i}$ with respect to $x,y\in
\left\{ c,l\right\} $ in period $t$ and assume that for all $(c,i)$ the $\lim_{x\rightarrow
0}U_{l}^{i}\left( c,x\right) =0$. The Ricardian flavored results in section \ref{sec:Ricardian101} hold under weaker assumptions about $U^{i}$,
while section \ref{Sec: quasilinear} assumes quasi-linear preferences in order to isolate key forces analytically.

An agent of type $i$ who supplies $l_{i}$ units of labor produces
$\theta_{i}\left(s_{t}\right)l_{i}$ units of output, where $\theta_{i}(s_{t})\in\Theta$
is a nonnegative state-dependent scalar. Feasible allocations satisfy
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn:feasiblity}
\sum_{i=1}^{I}n_{i}c_{i,t}+g_{t}=\sum_{i=1}^{I}n_{i}\theta_{i,t}l_{i,t}.
\end{equation}
\color{black}
Households and the government  trade a single, possibly risky, asset whose
\color{black}
%Since $B_{t}$ and all $b_{i,t}$ are bounded from below,  equation (\ref{feasibility bonds}) implies that they are also bounded from above.
time $t$ payoff $p_{t}$  is described by
\[
p_{t}=\mathbb{P}(s_{t}|s_{t-1}),
\]
where  $\mathbb{P}$ is an $S\times S$ matrix normalized to satisfy $\mathbb{E}_{t}p_{t+1}=1$.
Specifying the asset payoff in this way lets  us  investigate  consequences  of the correlation between asset returns, on the one hand,
and government expenditures or shocks to the skill distribution,  on the other hand.
Purchasing $\check b_t$ units of the asset at time $t$ at a time $t$ price of $q_t$ units of time $t$ consumption per unit of the asset
entitles the owner to $p_{t+1} \check b_t$ units of time $t+1$ consumption.  Consequently, $R_{t+1} = p_{t+1} / q_t$ is the gross rate of
return on the asset measured in units of time $t+1$ consumption good per unit of time $t$ consumption good.  We let $b_t \equiv q_t \check b_t$ denote
a time $t$ value of $\check b_t$ units of the asset, measured in units of time $t$ consumption.  From now on, we will express
 budget sets in terms of the gross rate of return $R_t$ and  counterparts of the value of assets $b_t$.
To facilitate a unified notation for budget constraints for dates $t \geq 0$, we define $R_0 \equiv p_0 \beta^{-1}$.
\color{black}

Households and the government begin with  assets $%
\{b_{i,-1}\}_{i=1}^{I}$ and $B_{-1}$, respectively. Asset holdings
satisfy the market clearing condition%
\begin{equation}
\label{feasibility bonds}
\sum_{i=1}^{I}n _{i}b_{i,t}+B_{t}=0\text{ for all }t\geq -1.
\end{equation}%
\color{black}
%The price of the single  asset at time $t$ is $q_t= q_t(s^t)$, so $R_{t}=\frac{p_t}{q_{t-1}}$ is  the one-period return on  the asset.
%from $t-1$ to $t$.

%shocks are a parsimonious way to capture variations in holding period returns on portfolio of the government due inflation risk, interest rate risk (for longer maturity bonds) or defaults risk.

There is a proportional labor tax rate $\tau_t$ and common lump transfer $T_t$.
The tax bill of an agent with wage earnings $l_{i,t}\theta_{i,t}$
is
\[
-T_{t}+\tau_{t}\theta_{i,t}l_{i,t}.
\]
%We allow the government to choose a feasible sequence of transfers $%%\{T_{t}\} $.
%\noindent We leave the sign of $T_{t}$  unrestricted.
A type $i$ agent's  budget constraint at $t \geq 0$ is%
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t}+b_{i,t}=\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta
_{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t}b_{i,t-1}+T_{t} \label{agent bc affine}
\end{equation}
%
% \noindent where $b_{i,t}$ denotes asset holdings of a type $i$ agent  at time $t\geq 0$.
and the government budget constraint is%
\begin{equation}
g_{t}+B_{t}=\tau _{t}\sum_{i=1}^{I}n_{i}\theta
_{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t}B_{t-1} -T_{t}.  \label{govmt bc affine}
\end{equation}%
%where $B_{t}$ denotes the government's assets at time $t$.


\begin{definition}
\label{Def:components} An \emph{allocation} is a sequence $\left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$. An \emph{asset profile} is a sequence $\{
\left \{ b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},B_{t}\}_{t}$. A \emph{returns process} is a sequence $\{R_{t}\}_{t}$. A \emph{tax policy} is a sequence $%
\{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\}_{t}$.
\end{definition}
%
%We next define a competitive equilibrium. The key feature of that definition
%is that equilibria defined for a given initial assets $\left( \left\{
%b_{i,-1}\right\} _{i},B_{-1}\right) $ and we study the implications of the
%initial assets on the equilibrium allocations.

\begin{remark}
\label{rem:debtlimits}
We impose debt limits on asset profiles.\footnote{For households, we shall impose natural debt limits that  depend
on the  tax policy. An alternative is to impose ad-hoc debt limits in the form of  exogenous history-contingent bounds
for each agent. Appendix \ref{appndx: credit limits and RE} discusses how restricting attention to natural debt limits for the households only shrinks the set of allocations that can
be implemented as competitive equilibria.}
%Owing to a Ricardian property, limits on gross government holdings are irrelevant (see section \ref{sec:Ricardian101}).\color{black}}
 \end{remark}



%
%
% Representative agent models usually impose debt limits on the government.
% Section XX describes that in our setting with affine taxes and heterogeneous agents, competitive allocations only pin down net asset positions.
% Thus $\tilde{D}_t=-(B_t-b_{i,t})$ for some $i$ is comparable to the notion of \emph{public debt} and we will assume that it is bounded.
% As far the households we will impose natural debt limits.
% These typically depend on the tax and transfer policies adopted by the government.\footnote{An alternative is to use ad-hoc debt limits which are exogenous history contingent bounds
% for each agent. Appendix XX discusses how restricting attention to natural debt limits for the households only shrinks the set of allocations that can
% be implemented as competitive equilibria.}

\begin{definition}
\label{Def: CE with affine taxes}For a given initial asset distribution $\left(
\left \{ b_{i,-1}\right
\} _{i},B_{-1}\right) $, a competitive
equilibrium with affine taxes is a sequence $\{ \left
\{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},B_{t},R_{t}\}_t$ and a tax policy $%
\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right
\} _{t}$ %such that the allocation and the
%private components $\left \{b_{i,t}\right \} _{t}$ of the asset profile
%$\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$
such that (i) $\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t} \} _{i,t}$
maximize (\ref{utility lifetime})\ subject to (\ref{agent bc affine}) and the condition that
$\{b_{i,t}\}_{i,t}$ satisfies the borrowing limits; and
(ii) constraints (\ref{eqn:feasiblity}),  (\ref%
{feasibility bonds}),and (\ref{govmt bc affine})\ are satisfied.
\end{definition}

%To rule out Ponzi schemes,we assume that $b_{i,t}$ must be bounded from below.  Generally these bounds can be constructed using natural debt limits (which are endogenous and depend on the tax, trasnfers policies) or adhoc limits that are some exogenous history contingent functions. For most of the paper we will focus on the natural limits which simplify our characterization but


%\textcolor{blue}{Each initial asset distribution $\left( \left\{

A Ramsey planner's preferences over  competitive equilibrium allocations are ordered by
\begin{equation}
\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{i=1}^{I}\omega_{i}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\beta^{t}U_{t}^{i}\left(c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right),\label{govmt objective}

where the Pareto weights satisfy $\omega_{i}\geq0,$ $\sum_{i=1}^{I}\omega_{i}=1$.

\subsection{Ricardian equivalence \label{sec:Ricardian101}}
%In this section we recover a \emph{Ricardian equivalence} result in the spirit of \citet{Barro1974}.
%We use this result to highlight that the level of government debt is not a state variable in our setting.
The arithmetic of budget constraints and market clearing instructs us how to  formulate the optimal policy problem concisely.
An equivalence class of tax policies and asset profiles supports the same competitive equilibrium allocation.

\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem: main} Given $\left( \left \{ b_{i,-1}\right \}
_{i},B_{-1}\right) $, let $\left \{ \left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},B_{t},R_{t}\right \} _{t} $ and $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right
\} _{t}$ be a competitive equilibrium. For any bounded sequences $%
\left \{ \hat{b}_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t\geq -1}$ that satisfy
\begin{equation*}
\hat{b}_{i,t}-\hat{b}_{1,t}=\tilde{b}_{i,t}\equiv b_{i,t}	-b_{1,t} \ \text{\rm  for all }t\geq -1,i\geq 2,
\end{equation*}%
there exist  sequences $\left \{ \hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t}$ and $%
\left \{ \hat{B}_{t}\right \} _{t\geq -1}$ that satisfy (\ref{feasibility
bonds}) and that make $\left \{ \left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}%
_{i,t}\right \} _{i},\hat{B}_{t},R_{t}\right \} _{t}$ and $\left \{
\tau _{t},\hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t}$ constitute a competitive
equilibrium given $\left( \left \{ \hat{b}_{i,-1}\right \} _{i},\hat{B}%
_{-1}\right) $.
\end{theorem}

We relegate the proof to appendix \ref{appndx: thm RE}. In the spirit of \citet{Barro1974}, we interpret Theorem \ref{theorem: main} as  asserting a type of  Ricardian equivalence.
Similar results  hold in more general environments. For example, we could allow
agents to trade all conceivable  Arrow securities and still show that  equilibrium allocations depend only on agents' net assets positions.

% \begin{proof}
% Let
% \begin{equation}
% \hat{T}_{t}=T_{t} + \left(\hat{b}_{1,t} - b_{1,t}\right) -
% R_{t-1}\left(\hat{b}_{1,t-1} - b_{1,t-1}\right) \text{ for
% all }t\geq 0.  \label{construct That}
% \end{equation}%
% Given  a tax policy $\left \{ \tau _{t},\hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t},$ the
% allocation $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}_{i,t}$ is a feasible choice for consumer $i$ since it satisfies%
% \begin{eqnarray*}
% c_{i,t}&=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}b_{i,t-1}-b_{i,t}+T_{t}\\
% &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\left( b_{i,t-1}-b_{1,t-1}\right) -\left(
% b_{i,t}-b_{1,t}\right) +T_{t}+R_{t-1}b_{1,t-1}-b_{1,t} \\
% &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\left( \hat{b}_{i,t-1}-\hat{b}_{1,t-1}\right) -\left( \hat{b%
% }_{i,t}-\hat{b}_{1,t}\right) +T_{t}+R_{t-1}b_{1,t-1}-b_{1,t} \\
%  &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta
% _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\hat{b}_{i,t-1}-\hat{b}_{i,t}+\hat{T}_{t}.
% \end{eqnarray*}%
% Suppose that $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}_{i,t}$ is not the optimal choice for consumer $i$, in the sense that there exists some
% other sequence $\left \{ \hat{c}_{i,t},\hat{l}_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}_{t}$ that gives strictly higher utility.  Then the choice $%
% \left \{ \hat{c}_{i,t},\hat{l}_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \}_{t}$ is
% feasible given the tax rates  $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \} _{t}$%
% , which contradicts the assumption that $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \}_{t}$ is the optimal choice for
% the consumer given taxes $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \}
% _{t}$. The new allocation satisfies all other constraints and
% therefore is an equilibrium.
% \end{proof}


%\smallskip An immediate corollary is  that it is not
%total government debt but rather who owns it that affects equilibrium
%allocations.

\begin{corollary}
\label{corr: B does not matter} For any pair $B_{-1}^{\prime },B_{-1}^{\prime
\prime }$, there are asset profiles $\left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime }\right\} _{i}$ and $%
\left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime \prime }\right\} _{i}$ such that
equilibrium allocations starting from  $\left( \left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime }\right\}
_{i},B_{-1}^{\prime }\right) $ and  from  $\left( \left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime
\prime }\right\} _{i},B_{-1}^{\prime \prime }\right) $ are the same.
%Such sequences $\left\{ b_{i,-1}^{\prime }\right\} _{i}$ and $\left\{
%b_{i,-1}^{\prime \prime }\right\} _{i}$
These asset profiles satisfy%
\begin{equation*}
b_{i,-1}^{\prime }-b_{1,-1}^{\prime }=b_{i,-1}^{\prime \prime
}-b_{1,-1}^{\prime \prime } \ \forall i.
\end{equation*}
\end{corollary}

Thus, total government debt is not what matters, who owns it does.
To  illustrate this point,
% and to
% appreciate how  Ricardian irrelevance affects optimal equilibria,
imagine an increase an
initial level of government debt from $0$ to some arbitrary level $%
B_{-1}^{\prime } < 0$. If the government were to hold transfers $\left\{ T_{t}\right\} _{t}$ fixed, it would
 have  to increase  tax rates $\left\{ \tau
_{t}\right\} _{t}$ enough to collect a present value of revenues sufficient to
repay $B_{-1}^{\prime }$. Since deadweight losses are convex in $\tau ,$
higher levels of debt financed with bigger distorting taxes $\{\tau_t\}_t$  impose larger
distortions and thereby degrade the equilibrium allocation.  But this would not happen  if
the government were instead  to adjust transfers in response to a higher initial debt. To determine suitable transfers, we need to
know who owns  the initial government debt. For example, suppose that agents own equal amounts. Then
each unit of debt repayment achieves the same redistribution as one
unit of transfers. If the original tax policy  at $B_{-1}^{\prime } =0 $ were optimal, then  the best policy for a government with  initial debt $%
B_{-1}^{\prime } <0 $ would be to reduce the present value of  transfers by exactly the amount of the
increase in per capita debt. Then the labor  tax rate sequence  $\left\{ \tau
_{t}\right\}_t $ and the allocation could both remain unchanged.\footnote{This example illustrates
principles proclaimed by Simon \citet[p. 85]{newcomb1865critical} in the quotation that begins
 this paper.}

%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: let's find the quote again and put it at the beginning of the paper  once more.}

The situation would be different if  holdings of government
debt were not equal across agents. For example, suppose  that  richer people initially  own disproportionately more government debt. That would mean that inequality
is  effectively initially  higher in an economy with higher initial government debt. As a result, a
government with Pareto weights $\{\omega_i\}_i$ that favor equality would want to increase both   transfers $\left\{ T_{t}\right\}_t $  and the distorting labor  tax rate $\left\{ \tau _{t}\right\}_t$
to offset the increase in inequality
associated with the increase in government debt. The conclusion would be the
opposite if government debt were to be  owned mostly by poorer
households.



This logic confirms the importance of  the distribution of government debt across people. Government debt that is widely and evenly distributed
(e.g., implicit Social Security debt) is less distorting than
 government debt owned mostly by people whose incomes are at the top of the income
distribution (e.g., government debt held by hedge funds).\footnote{%
It is possible to extend our analysis to open economy with foreign
holdings of domestic debt. The more government debt is owned by the
foreigners, the higher are the distorting taxes that  the government  needs to
impose.}
\color{black}
%
%We use
%the insight in theorem \ref{theorem: main}  that  the tax policy and asset profile
%%$\left\{\left\{b_{i,t}^{\ast }\right\}
%%_{i},B_{t}^{\ast }\right\} _{t}$
%contain some information that it is convenient to eliminate to concisely  formulate the Ramsey problem.

Throughout this paper we avail ourselves of Theorem \ref{theorem: main} to impose a normalization on  asset profiles:
%shows that many  transfer
%sequences $\left\{ T_{t}\right\} _{t}$ and asset profiles $\left\{
%b_{i,t},B_{t}\right\} _{i,t}$  support the same  equilibrium allocation.
%As such we use a normalization to define the notion of \emph{public debt} for our setting.
we assume that productivities are ordered as  $\theta_{1,t}\geq\theta_{2,t}\ldots\geq \theta_{I,t}$ and set $b_{I,t}=0$. With this normalization we can recover canonical representative agent incomplete market sets up with linear taxes and debt as in \cite{Chari1994},\cite{Aiyagari2002} if government does not care about redistribution, as explained in more details in \ref{Sec: quasilinear}. This allows us to interpret $-B_t=\sum_{i<I}n_ib_{i,t}$ as
public debt and limits on $\sum_{i<I}n_ib_{i,t}$ are counterparts  to  debt limits in a representative agent economy. 
% \textbf{Anmol XXXXXX: 1.  I am not sure what the last sentence means and think it could be disposed of or else should be sharpened.

\section{Quasilinear preferences}\label{Sec: quasilinear}

In our general   section \ref{Sec: environment} setting, the endogeneity of the return on the single asset and the multiplicity $I$ of types of agents makes it
difficult to parse the forces that govern how  transfers are optimally used to smooth tax rate distortions and to redistribute across people. 
In this section, we analyze a special case that helps us isolate key  forces. We assume two types of agents who have one-period utility functions that are quasi-linear in consumption. This  makes the return on the asset exogenous. It in turn allows us to focus on how
the comovement between returns and aggregate risk affects how transfers are used to smooth tax distortions and to redistribute.



\begin{assumption}
\label{ass quasilinear}
Quasilinear preferences: $u(c,l)=c-\frac{l^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}$
\end{assumption}
\begin{assumption}
 $\theta_1>\theta_2=0$
\end{assumption}
\begin{assumption}
\label{ass iid}
IID shocks to expenditure: $g(s_t)$ is i.i.d over time
\end{assumption}
Assuming one type of agent who cannot work makes the  redistribution between rich and poor transparent, and i.i.d shocks help with analytical tractability.  With i.i.d shocks we can restrict our attention to  payoff matrices $\mathbb{P}$ that have identical rows denoted by a vector $P(s)$ with a normalization  $\mathbb{E}P(s)=1$. At interior solutions, the first-order conditions for the household's problem for $l_{1,t}$ and $b_{i,t}$ imply that
\begin{eqnarray*}
l_{1,t}^\gamma & = &(1-\tau_t) \theta \cr
R_t & = & \frac{P(s_t)}{\beta},
\end{eqnarray*}
where we set  $R_{0}=\beta^{-1} P(s_0)$. Substituting these into the  budget constraint \eqref{agent bc affine} gives %, the implementability constraints become
 
 \begin{subequations}
 \begin{equation} \label{budget consts substitution agent 1} c_{1,t} + b_{1,t} = l_{1,t}^{1+\gamma} + \frac{P(s_t)}{\beta} b_{1,t-1}+T_t, \quad t \geq 0.
 \end{equation}

 \begin{equation} \label{budget consts substitution agent 2} c_{2,t} + b_{2,t} =  \frac{P(s_t)}{\beta} b_{2,t-1}+T_t, \quad t \geq 0.
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Subtract the budget constraint of the unproductive agent \eqref{budget consts substitution agent 2} from \eqref{budget consts substitution agent 1} to eliminate transfers $T_t$
and get 
 \begin{equation} \label{implementability constraint ql} c_{1,t} -c_{2,t} + b_{1,t}-b_{2,t} = l_{1,t}^{1+\gamma} + \frac{P(s_t)}{\beta} [b_{1,t-1}-b_{2,t-1}], \quad t \geq 0.
 \end{equation}
 
 Equation \eqref{implementability constraint ql} presents a recursive version of the implementability constraints appropriate for the quasilinear setting. We next use the Ricardian equivalence result summarized in theorem \ref{theorem: main} and corollary \ref{corr: B does not matter}
of  section \ref{sec:Ricardian101} to  normalize the assets of the unproductive agent, $b_{2,t}$  to zero\footnote{ We will adhere to this normalization throughout this section}.  This allows us to calculate transfers as $T_t=c_{2,t}$. Our last assumption is to impose a non-negativity constraint on the consumption of the unproductive agent. Requiring that $c_{2t} \geq 0$ is  an easy way to make transfers  costly
to the Ramsey planner for some values of the Pareto weights. \footnote{In absence of this constraint, the quasi linear case has a trivial solution where the Ramsey plan has constant taxes and asset holdings for all $t\geq0$.} 

\begin{assumption}
\label{ass non negativity}
$c_{2,t}\geq0$
\end{assumption}


\noindent The asset market clearing condition implies that   $nb_{1,t} = -B_t$. 

\noindent Let $(\omega,n) \in [0,1] \times [0,1]$ be the Pareto weight and mass assigned to the  productive type $1$ agent and $V(B\_)$ be the value of the Ramsey plan with initial government assets $B\_$.
Then the Bellman equation for the Ramsey planner
is: 


\begin{equation}
V(B\_)=\max_{\{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),B(s)\}_s} \sum_{s}\pi(s)\left\{\omega \left(c_{1}(s)-\frac{l_{1}(s)^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}\right)+(1-\omega)c_{2(s)}   +\beta V(B(s))    \right\} \end{equation}
where the maximization is subject to
   \begin{subequations}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{implementability constraint}
   c_1(s)-c_2(s)-n^{-1}B(s)=l_1(s)^{1+\gamma}+n^{-1}\beta^{-1} P(s)B\_
    \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
  \label{eq-resoruces}
nc_1(s)+(1-n)c_2(s)+g(s)\leq\theta l_1(s)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{non negativity}
c_2(s)\geq0
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
  \label{ndl}
\underline{B}\leq B(s)\leq \overline{B}
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}   


We will proceed our characterization of the Ramsey plan in two parts. First we consider the case when the Pareto weight of the productive agent is high enough; this is useful because of Lemma \ref{lemma threshold} below,
\begin{lemma}
\label{lemma threshold}
Assume that $n<\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$, if $\omega\geq n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$ then $T_t=0 \quad \forall t\geq0$.  

\end{lemma}

For a Pareto weight on the productive agent above a threshold $\bar{\omega}=n\left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$ the Ramsey  planner chooses always to set transfers to zero.
They are just too costly.      Positive  transfers  entail subsidizing the unproductive type 2 agents
whose consumption he values too little. The $T_t = 0$ outcome  makes  the Ramsey  plan
in the two-type of agents economy be  identical to the Ramsey plan for the representative agent economy with no lump sum transfers. It also justifies our normalization where we can interpret $-B_t$ as public debt. We characterize the dynamics of debt and taxes for this case and then discuss what happens when the Pareto weight of the productive agent is low. 
  
\subsubsection{Representative agent economy with no transfers}
The key issue in this section is how market incompleteness, as captured by the structure of payoff on the asset $P(s)$,  impedes  tax-smoothing  in a joint ergodic distribution for the tax rate and government debt. The representative agent  economy  interpretation extends and unifies  results from the complete markets economy of \cite{LucasJr.1983} and the risk-free-bond-only economy of  \citep{Aiyagari2002}. 

To organize analytical results in theorems \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} and \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}, it is useful to  collect some  $P(s)$ vectors that are perfectly correlated with expenditure shocks $g(s)$ in the
following  set %of payoffs
 indexed by  constants $B^*$  %$\mathcal{P}^*$ defined below,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:setP}
 \mathcal{P}^*=\left\{P^*(s): P^*(s) = 1+ \frac{\beta}{ B^*}(g(s) - \mathbb{E} g) \text{ for some } B^*\in[\overline{B},\underline{B}] \right\}.
 \end{equation}

%This set of payoffs indexed by $B^*$ will help us organize our main results for the representative agent economy.


%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: we have to define the value function $V(B)$ earlier. }


\begin{theorem}
\label{thm: rep agent general theorem}
In a representative agent economy satisfying assumptions \ref{ass quasilinear} and \ref{ass iid}, the behavior of  government assets under a Ramsey plan
can be characterized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item Suppose $P(s) \not \in \mathcal{P}^*$.  There is an invariant distribution of government assets such that

\[\forall \epsilon>0, \quad \Pr\{B_t<\underline{B}+\epsilon  \ \text{ or } B_t>\overline{B}-\epsilon \quad i.o \}=1\]

\item Suppose  $P(s)-P(s')>\frac{\beta}{-\underline{B}}[g(s')-g(s)]\quad \forall s,s'$.
The value function $V(B\_)$ is strictly concave and there exist $B_1<B_2$ such that

\[\mathbb{E}V'(B(s))>V'(B\_) \quad \ for \ B\_>B_2 \]
and
\[\mathbb{E}V'(B(s))<V'(B\_) \quad \ for \  B\_<B_1 \]
These inequalities imply that for large enough government assets (or debt),
assets drift towards an interior region. %\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: I have moved the preceding sentence down below the value function  derivative inequalities.}
\item Suppose $P(s)\in \mathcal{P}^*$.  Government assets converge to a degenerate steady state
\[\lim_tB_t=  B^*\quad a.s \quad \forall B_{-1} \]
where $B^*$ is the object appearing in definition \eqref{eqn:setP} of $\mathcal{P}^*$ and satisfies,
\begin{equation} \label{ss-debt} B^*=\beta \frac{\var(g(s))}{\cov(P(s),g(s))}. \end{equation}
The long-run tax rate is inversely related to $B^*$ and satisfies:
\[\lim_{B^*\to\underline{B}}\tau^*=\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}, \quad \lim_{B^*\to\infty}\tau^*=-\infty .\]

\end{enumerate}


\end{theorem}


%\textbf{Anmol --  I  edited the following paragraph heavily. Let's talk about it.}
\color{black}
Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}  describes how  the invariant distribution of government assets depends on the payoff vector $P(s)$.
Part 1 of theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}  establishes that when the payoff vector does  not belong to $\mathcal{P}^*$, the support of the invariant distribution of assets is wide in the sense that almost all
asset sequences recurrently revisit  small neighborhoods of  any arbitrary lower and upper bounds on government assets.
Because the labor tax rate is decreasing in government assets, it varies too. These outcomes contrast sharply with those   in a corresponding complete market benchmark
like \citeauthor{LucasJr.1983}'s, where both debt and tax rates would be constant  sequences,  and with those in the incomplete markets economy of  \citeauthor{Aiyagari2002},
  where government assets approach levels that allow the  limiting tax rate to be zero and the tail allocation to be first-best.

With more structure on the payoff vector, part 2 of  theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} shows that there is an  inward drift to government assets:
the sequence of Lagrange multipliers on the sequence of implementability constraints forms a sub (or super) martingale in  regions with low (or high) assets.
The envelope theorem links the dynamics of the multiplier to the dynamics  of government assets.  The concavity of the value function implies
mean reversion for government  asset holdings. Mean reversion is particularly stark when $P(s)\in \mathcal{P}^*(s)$: here  government assets converges to
the constant $B^*$ appearing in  definition \eqref{eqn:setP} of the set $\mathcal{P}^*(s)$.\footnote{Thus, the limiting allocation matches the allocation in
a particular \citeauthor{LucasJr.1983} economy  with constant government  assets and taxes; however,
the level and the sign of long-run government assets is determined by the joint properties of shocks and payoffs rather than
by the initial government assets,  as it is in the \citeauthor{LucasJr.1983} model.}



In part 3 of theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} where  $P(s)\in\mathcal{P}^*$,
after government assets have converged to $B^*$, % under the case 3 that assumes that  $P(s)\in\mathcal{P}^*$,
the government perfectly hedges fluctuations in
its net-of-interest deficit.   Whether the government eventually holds assets or owes  debt is determined
by the sign of the covariance of $P(s)$ with $g(s)$.
Keeping the tax rate and therefore tax revenues constant, the government must finance
a higher primary deficit when it gets a positive expenditure shock.
If the asset returns more when government expenditures are high, the asset is a good hedge. In this situation, the government optimally holds positive assets and uses high returns
on its holding to finance its  net-of-interest deficit. On the other hand,  if  payoffs on the asset  are lower  when the
government's net-of-interest deficit is high, then owing government debt is useful because it helps  lower the government's interest burden in the face of adverse government expenditure shocks.

%government's net-of-interest deficit is high, then owing government debt is useful because it helps  lower the government's interest burden in the face of adverse government expenditure shocks.

To acquire more information about the invariant distribution of government debt when the payoff vector $P(s)$ is close to  the set $\mathcal{P}^*$, in  theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies} we linearize the law of motion for  government assets to approximate %. Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}
  the mean and variance of the invariant distribution of government assets.
We employ an  orthogonal decomposition of an arbitrary $P(s) \not \in \mathcal{P}^*$, namely,
\[P(s)=\hat{P}(s)+P^*(s)\] where $P^*(s)\in \mathcal{P}^*$ and $\hat{P}(s)$ is orthogonal to $g(s)$. We carefully  choose the point
$P^*(s)$ about which we take a linear  approximation, namely,
a closest (in an $l_2$ sense) complete market economy that  serves as the steady state of an economy for  some $P^*(s)\in\mathcal{P}^*(s)$.
Exploiting the structure of these approximate laws of motion allows us to obtain bounds on the standard deviation of government  assets in the
ergodic distribution and also the rate at which the mean asset level converges, a rate  that can be expressed in terms of primitives in the form
of the joint distribution of shocks and payoffs.

%Expanding the Ramsey plan around the steady state of the $P^*(s)$ economy's Ramsey outcome  we obtain
%the next theorem.
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm: rep agent linear policies}
Under a  first order approximation of dynamics around $P^*(s)$, the ergodic distribution of government assets has the following properties:
\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Mean:} The ergodic mean is $B^*$ and thus equals the steady state level of government assets  of an economy with payoff vector $P^*(s)$.
 \item \textbf{Variance:} The ergodic coefficient of variation of government assets $B$ is
  \[
    \frac{\sigma(B)}{\mathbb E(B)} = \sqrt\frac{\var(P(s)) - |\cov(g(s),P(s))|}{(1+|\cov(g(s),P(s))|)|\cov(g(s),P(s))|}\leq\sqrt\frac{\var(\hat{P}(s))}{\var(P^*(s))}
  \]
  \item \textbf{Convergence rate:} The speed of convergence to the ergodic distribution is
  \[
    \frac{\EE_{t-1}(B_t-B^*)}{(B_{t-1} - B^*)} = \frac1{1+|\cov(P(s),g(s))|}.
  \]

\end{itemize}


\end{theorem}
 We relegate the proof to appendix  \ref{appndx: ergodic distribution linearization}, where we describe how %We construct  $P^* $ as the projection of $P$ onto the space spanned by $\mathcal{P}^*$.
we take a first-order Taylor approximation to the decision rules and laws of motion for the state variables of our
economy around complete market counterparts associated with $P^*\in \mathcal{P}^*$.
An important feature is that the point about which the  approximation is taken is not a deterministic steady state.
The appendix also describes the accuracy of the approximation.
%\footnote{Appendix \ref{appndx: ergodic distribution linearization} contains more details of the approximation method and a discussion about the accuracy of the approximation.}
%\end{remark}


 Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} established  that when the payoff vector is $P^*(s)$ and the government's assets equal $B^*$, the
 planner  wants the government  to keep the tax rate constant and thereby perfectly  hedge fluctuations in its net-of-interest deficit
by using fluctuations in the earnings  $P^*(s)B^*$ from its  portfolio.  When $P(s) \not \in \mathcal{P}^*$, the incompleteness of markets prevents complete hedging, so  shocks are only imperfectly
hedged with a combination of changes in the tax rate
and the level of government debt. Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}  asserts   how  deviations from $\mathcal{P}^*$ map into larger variances for government debt and the tax rate
under the ergodic distribution. Figure \ref{fig: ergodic distribution ql} illustrates  how the ergodic distribution of government debt and the tax rate spread as we
exogenously alter  the covariance of $P(s)$ with $g(s)$. \footnote{For the purposes of these graphs we used the global approximation to the policy rules using standard projection methods rather than the linear approximations appealed to in Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}.}

%We now  turn to another  special economy, one that now features both  heterogeneous agents and  transfers.

\subsubsection{Two agent quasilinear case}

The previous section worked out in detail the case where the Pareto weight on the productive type 1 agent where high enough and as such transfers were not used to hedge aggregate shocks. Theorem \ref{thm heterogeneous agents} now completes the characterization by describing outcomes when  the Pareto weight on the productive agent are low and transfers are in part effective in hedging. 
 
 
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm heterogeneous agents}
Let $(\omega,n) \in [0,1] \times [0,1]$ be the Pareto weight and mass assigned to the  productive type $1$ agent.  Assume that $n<\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$.
The optimal tax rate, transfer, and government asset policies $\{\tau_t,T_t,B_t\}_t$ are characterized as follows:


\begin{enumerate}
 \item For $\omega\geq n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$,  $T_t=0$.  The optimal tax rate, government debt policy is same as in the representative agent economy studied in
 theorems \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} and \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}.
 \item For $\omega< n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$, suppose that $\min_{s}\{P(s)\}>\beta$. There exist  a $\mathcal{B}(\omega)$  satisfying $\mathcal{B}'(\omega)>0$ and a $\tau^*(\omega)$ such that
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item If $B\_>\mathcal{B(\omega)}$
\[T_t>0, \quad \tau_t=\tau^*(\omega), \textit{ and } B_t=B\_ \quad \forall t \geq 0 \]
\item If $B\_\leq \mathcal{B(\omega)}$, the Ramsey policies depend on the structure of $P(s)$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $P(s)\not \in \mathcal{P}^*$

   \[ T_t>0 \text{ i.o.},\quad \lim_t\tau_t=\tau^*(\omega) \text{ and } \lim_tB_t=\mathcal{B}(\omega)\quad \textit{a.s}\]

 \item If $P(s)\in \mathcal{P}^*$, we have two cases depending on $B\_$
\begin{enumerate}
 \item If $B\_\leq B^*$
 \[T_t = 0, \quad \lim_t \tau_t=\tau^{**} (\omega), \ {\rm  and } \lim_tB_t=  B^*\quad a.s \]
\item If $\mathcal{B}(\omega)>B\_>B^*$
\small
\[\Pr\{\lim_t T_t = 0, \lim_t \tau_t=\tau^{**}(\omega),\lim_tB_t=  B^* \textrm{ or }  T_t>0 \text{ i.o.} \ {\rm and } \lim_t\tau_t=\tau^*(\omega), \lim_tB_t=\mathcal{B}(\omega) \}=1 \]
 \normalsize
\end{enumerate}

%\textbf{Tom and David XXXXX: Lets talk about the assertions in the last line.}


 \end{enumerate}

 \end{enumerate}

 \end{enumerate}


\end{theorem}



We relegate the proof to appendix \ref{apndx: proof heterogeneous agent}. 

\color{black}
%\textbf{Anmol and Tom:  I want to discuss some of the sentences in the next two paragraphs and seek clarification.}
 Part 1 simply summarizes the representative agent case for completeness. Things change in part 2  of Theorem \ref{thm heterogeneous agents} with a more progressive  $\omega<\bar{\omega}$ Ramsey planner.
Fluctuating transfers  now become a useful  tool to  hedge aggregate shocks.
 %as the costs are typically lower depend jointly on Pareto weights and the distribution of assets across the agents, or equivalently the level of government assets $B_t$ (under our normalization that the unproductive agent has zero assets).
  If the government begins with enough assets (as in part 2.a of  Theorem \ref{thm heterogeneous agents}),
   the planner
  chooses an interior allocation in which {\em all} fluctuations in net-of interest deficits are always financed by fluctuating transfers $T_t$.
   Here  the tax rate is  constant and government assets remain at their initial level where %. At this initial  level government assets,
    the marginal welfare costs of labor taxes are equated
 to the marginal welfare costs of transfers. Part 2.b describes a setting in which  government assets too low (and $P(s)\not \in \mathcal{P}^*$) to validate the part 2.a outcome.  Here the planner eventually accumulates government  assets until they reach the threshold $\mathcal{B}(\omega)$
 %.  At this level,
at which the welfare  costs of transfers are  low enough that the government  can  keep the tax rate constant.
The government's decision under the conditions of part 2  to accumulate enough  assets so that
 eventually it can use earnings on its assets together with fluctuating positive  transfers to hedge fiscal shocks is reminiscent of outcomes in the \cite{Aiyagari2002} economy. There, with a representative agent and non-negativity constraints on transfers, the planner
accumulated enough assets so that it could finance shocks with zero distortionary labor taxes while costlessly using transfers
to dispose of excess earnings on its asset holdings. With multiple agents, fluctuating transfers can may bring welfare costs that  depend on
the Ramsey's planner attitude about  redistribution. Theorem \ref{thm heterogeneous agents} describes how Pareto weights that  make the planner care more about the unproductive agent lower the marginal welfare costs of collecting revenue from labor taxes paid by the productive agent. The planner thus increases the labor tax rate, lowering the threshold level of assets that are required to finance all shocks by transfers. Thus a more redistributive planner relies more on transfers and consequently has less cause to accumulate assets to hedge aggregate shocks.

\section{More general preferences}
\label{Sec: more general economies}

% We now focus on the characterization of optimal plans by applying  the primal approach.
% This involves using household optimality conditions to obtain a set of restrictions on allocations chosen by the government to ensure that they are `implementable' as competitive equilibria. In the last section we describe a recursive formulation of the Ramsey plan.
%We use the state  dimension reduction  from subsection \ref{sec:Ricardian101} to  formulate the Ramsey problem.
%Following \citet{LucasJr.1983} and \citet{Aiyagari2002}, we use households' first-order necessary conditions to describe restrictions on competitive
%equilibrium allocations.
The quasilinearity of utilities maintained throughout  section \ref{Sec: quasilinear} set  the equilibrium  return on the asset to $\beta^{-1}P(s)$.
Adding curvature to utility from consumption  makes the  return on the asset   endogenous even for a risk-free bond having a payoff vector $P(s)=1$. We begin with a pair of Bellman equations that formulate the  Ramsey plan recursively, with relative marginal utilities of consumption as state variables. Here  and also in section  \ref{sec: numerical results}, we  use these Bellman equations to analyze several economies  with utility functions that are strictly concave in consumption.

With natural borrowing limits for households, first-order necessary conditions for the  household's problem
 are%
\begin{equation}
\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}U_{c,t}^{i}=-U_{l,t}^{i},
\label{FOC consumption labor}
\end{equation}%
and%
\begin{equation}
U_{c,t}^{i}=\beta\mathbb{E}_{t}R_{t+1}U_{c,t+1}^{i}.  \label{FOC Euler}
\end{equation}%
To help characterize an equilibrium, we use

\begin{theorem}
\label{prop: affine eqm nec and suff}A sequence $\{ \left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},R_{t},\tau _{t},T_{t}\}_t$ is part of
a competitive equilibrium with affine taxes if and only if it satisfies (\ref{eqn:feasiblity}), (\ref{agent bc affine}), (\ref{FOC consumption labor}%
), and (\ref{FOC Euler}) and $b_{i,t}$ is bounded for all $i$ and $t.$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Necessity is obvious. In  appendix   \ref{appndx: affine eqm nec and stuff}, we use arguments of \cite{Magill1994} and \cite{Constantinides1996} to show that any $\left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$ that satisfies (\ref{agent bc
affine}), (\ref{FOC consumption labor}), and (\ref{FOC Euler}) solves consumer $i$'s  problem. Equilibrium $\{B_{t}\}_t$ is determined by
(\ref{feasibility bonds}) and constraint (\ref{govmt bc affine}) is then
implied by Walras' Law
\end{proof}

By Theorem  \ref{prop: affine eqm nec and suff}, to find an optimal equilibrium
we can choose $\{ \left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},R_{t},\tau
_{t},T_{t}\}_{t}$ to maximize (\ref{govmt objective}) subject to (\ref{eqn:feasiblity}), (\ref{agent bc affine}), (\ref{FOC consumption labor}), and (\ref{FOC Euler}).
% The last two constraints determine $\left \{ R_{t},\tau _{t}\right \}
%_{t} $ and are not featured anywhere else in maximization, so the
%allocations can be optimized over $\{\left \{
%c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},,T_{t}\}_t$ which often simplifies
%optimization.
We  apply a first-order approach and follow steps similar to those taken by \cite{LucasJr.1983} and \citet{Aiyagari2002}.
 Substituting consumers' first-order
conditions (\ref{FOC consumption labor})\ and (\ref{FOC Euler})\ into the
budget constraints (\ref{agent bc affine}) yields the implementability constraints % for  $t\geq 1 $,
\begin{equation}
c_{i,t}+b_{i,t}=-\frac{U_{l,t}^{i}}{U_{c,t}^{i}}l_{i,t}+T_{t}+\frac{%
p_tU_{c,t-1}^{i}}{\beta \mathbb{E}_{t-1}p_tU_{c,t}^{i}}b_{i,t-1}\ \forall i \geq 1 ,t \geq 1,  \label{affine implementability a}
\end{equation}
and %  $t=0$, we normalize $R_{-1,0}=P(s_0)\beta^{-1}$ to get,

\begin{equation}
\label{affine implementability a t=0}
c_{i,0}+b_{i,0}=-\frac{U_{l,0}^{i}}{U_{c,0}^{i}}l_{i,0}+T_{0}+
p_0 \beta^{-1}b_{i,-1}\ \forall i \geq 1.
\end{equation}

%\textbf{Anmol XXXXXX: here there is an issue about the ranges of $i$ and $t$.  It seems it is for $t \geq 1 $ because of the appearence
%of $E_{t-1} (\cdot)$.  Let's talk about this. This issue appears recurrently. I'll flag them below.}
\noindent For $I\geq 2$, we can use constraints (\ref{affine implementability
a}) and (\ref{affine implementability
a t=0}) for  $i=I$ to eliminate $T_{t}$ for $i < I$. Letting $\tilde{b}%
_{i,t}\equiv b_{i,t}-b_{I,t}$, we can represent the implementability constraints
as
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{affine implementability b}
&&\left( c_{i,t}-c_{I,t}\right) +\tilde{b}_{i,t}\\
&=&-\frac{U_{l,t}^{i}}{U_{c,t}^{i}}l_{i,t}+\frac{U^1_{l,t}}{U^1_{c,t}}l_{I,t} +\frac{p_tU_{c,t-1}^{i}}{\beta \mathbb{E}%
_{t-1}p_tU_{c,t}^{i}}\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}\ \text{\rm for \ }i>1 \ \text{\rm and \ } t\geq 1,  \notag
\end{eqnarray}
%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: the range of $t$.}
so that  the planner's
maximization problem involves only on the $I-1$ variables $\tilde{b}_{i,t-1}.$
%The reduction of  the dimensionality from \ $I$ to $I-1$ is
% a consequence of corollary \ref{corr: B does not matter} of theorem \ref{theorem: main}.


Let $\bm{x}= \left( U_{c}^{1}\tilde{b}_{1},...,U_{c}^{I-1}\tilde{b}_{I-1}\right)$, $\bm{\rho }=\left( U_{c}^{1}/U_{c}^{I},...,U_{c}^{I-1}/U_{c}^{I}\right) $, and denote an allocation $a=\{c_i,l_i\}^{I}_{i=1}.$
Following \cite{Kydland1980} and \cite{Farhi2010}, we split the Ramsey problem into a time-$0$ problem that takes $(\{\tilde{b}_{i,-1}\}^{I-1}_{i=1}, s_0)$ as state variables
and   a time $t \geq 1$ continuation problem  that takes $(\bm x,\bm \rho,s\_)$ as state variables. There are
two value functions, one that pertains to $t\geq 1$, another to $t=0$.\footnote{The time inconsistency of an optimal policy
manifests itself in there being distinct value functions and Bellman equations at $t =0$ and $t \geq 1$. For the quasilinear cases in sections \ref{Sec: quasilinear}, the Ramsey plans are time consistent.}  As usual, we work backwards and describe the time $t \geq 1$ Bellman equation
first, and then the time $t=0$ Bellman equation.

\smallskip
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol: I have changed both the Bellman equations to incorporate $\beta$ shocks inline of David's suggestion}
For $t\geq1$, let $V(\bm{x},\bm{\rho },s\_)$ be the planner's  continuation value  given $\bm x_{t-1}=\bm x,\bm \rho_{t-1}=\bm \rho,s_{t-1}=s\_$. It satisfies the Bellman equation
%\textcolor{green}{David:  It seems to me that given that this is the Bellman equation we expect readers to refer to throughout the paper it might be good to allow for the possibility of discount factor shocks.  In which case the implementability should be

\subsection{Eventual complete hedging with binary shocks}\label{sec:2complete}

In this  subsection, we  present  a class of  economies with binary IID shocks  in which  the Ramsey planner can achieve complete hedging even when preferences are not quasilinear in consumption. % These economies have  IID shocks that take two values.
 Comovements of   asset return with exogenous shocks govern the government's incentive to accumulate assets, an outcome reminiscent of the section \ref{Sec: quasilinear}  economy with quasilinear preferences.
However, now the comovement of asset returns is endogenous.

For a given state $\left(
\bm{x},\bm{\rho },s\_\right) $, let  $\Psi \left( s;\bm{x},%
\bm{\rho },s\_\right) =\left( x^{\prime }\left( s\right) ,\rho ^{\prime
}\left( s\right) \right) $  solve (\ref{eq:BM2}) so that $\Psi \left( s;\bm{x},\bm{\rho },s\_\right) $ is the law of motion for the state variables
under a Ramsey plan at $t \geq 1$.
\begin{definition} \label{defn: steady state}
 A steady state % $\left( \bm{x}^{SS},\bm{\rho} ^{SS}\right) $
 satisfies $\left(\bm{ x}^{SS},\bm{\rho}
^{SS}\right) =\Psi \left( s;\bm{x}^{SS},\bm{\rho} ^{SS},s_{-}\right) $ for all $%
\,s,s\_.$
\end{definition}
In a steady state, the ratios  of marginal utilities  $\rho_i =U_{c}^{i}(s)/U_{c}^{I}(s)$ and marginal utility adjusted net assets $x_i=U^i_c(s)\tilde{b}_i$ are constant;
%the ratios of marginal utilities
%of  all agents are constant.
this means that the continuation allocation depends only on  $s_{t}$ and not on the  history $s^{t-1}$.\footnote{History dependence
is entirely intermediated through variation of $\{x_i,\rho_i\}_i$.}

We now construct a  set of economies having steady states. A competitive equilibrium  allocation $\{c_i(s),l_i(s)\}_{i}$ associated with a choice for $\{\tau(s), \bm{\rho}(s)\}$ is determined by
equations (\ref{eq:BM2_Wages_cons}), (\ref{eq:BM2_Res_cons}) and (\ref{eq:BM2_rhoprime}). Denote $U(\tau,\bm{\rho},s)$ as
the value of that competitive equilibrium allocation to a planner with Pareto weights $\{\omega_i\}$:
\[U(\tau,\bm{\rho},s|\{\omega_i\})=\sum_{i}\omega_i U^i(s).\]
%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: do you not want $\omega$ as an argument of $U$?}
As before, define $Z_i(\tau,\rho,s)$ as
\[Z_i(\tau,\bm \rho,s)=U^i_c(s)c_i(s)+U^i_l(s)l_i(s)-\rho_i(s)\left[U^I_c(s)c_I(s)+U^I_l(s)l_I(s)\right].\]
% Note that $\sum_{i=2}^{N}Z_i(\tau,\bm  \rho,s)$ is the marginal utility adjusted  primary deficit using the implied allocation.
%
%
%
% %Next we define $Z(\tau,\rho,s)$ as the marginal utility adjusted primary deficit using the implied allocation.
% \[Z(\tau, \bm \rho,s)=c_1^{-\sigma}(s)\left\{NT(s)+g-\tau(s)\sum_{i=1}^{N}\left[\theta_il_i(s)\right]\right\}\]
%
%
When shocks are IID,  the Ramsey  policy from $t\geq 1$ solves the following Bellman equation in $\bm{x}(s^{t-1})=\bm{x},\bm{\rho}(s^{t-1})=\bm{\rho}$
%
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:ss-obj}
 	V(\bm x,\bm \rho) = \max_{\tau(s),\bm \rho'(s),\bm x'(s)}\sum_s \pi(s)\left[ U(\tau(s),\bm \rho'(s),s) + \beta V(\bm x'(s),\bm \rho'(s))\right]
 \end{equation}
where the maximization is subject to the constraints
 \begin{equation}
 \label{eq:ss-imp}
 	Z_i(\tau(s),\bm \rho'(s),s) + x'_i(s) = \frac{x_i \beta^{-1}P(s) U^i_c(\tau(s),\bm \rho'(s),s)}{\mathbb{E} P U^i_c(\tau,\rho)}\text{   for all  $s,i < I$,}\\
 \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:bondcondtion}
 	\sum_s \pi(s)P(s)U^1_c(\tau(s),\bm \rho'(s),s)(\rho_i'(s)-\rho_i) = 0 \text{  for $i < I.$}
\end{equation}
 Constraint (\ref{eq:bondcondtion}), which rearranges constraint (\ref{eq:BM2_Bonds_cons}),  implies that $\rho(s)$ is a risk-adjusted martingale.

 Our  next job is to study conditions that render the first-order necessary conditions and feasibility as
 compressed into \eqref{eq:ss-imp} and  \eqref{eq:bondcondtion}
 consistent with the requirement that the implied  law of motion for the state variables is a steady state associated with definition \ref{defn: steady state}.\footnote{Appendix \ref{apndx: numerical methods} discusses  second-order conditions that ensure these policies are optimal.}

% \textbf{Anmol XXXXXXX: I don't like the language ``steady
% state restrictions imposed on policies''.  What do we mean?}
 %\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: has a notion of ``stationary policies'' been defined anywhere?  Either it should be or the preceding sentence should be made more precise.}
 \begin{lemma}\label{lemma-simplified-foc}
When utility is strictly concave in consumption,  $\|S\|=2$ is necessary for a steady state to exist generically.
% \textbf{Anmol: is this precisely what you want to say -- necessity
%versus sufficiency?}
 \end{lemma}
 \begin{proof}
   Let $\pi(s)\mu_i(s)$ and $\lambda_i$ be Lagrange multipliers on constraints (\ref{eq:ss-imp}) and (\ref{eq:bondcondtion}).
   Imposing the restrictions $x'_i(s) = x_i$ and $\rho'_i(s) = \rho_i$, at a  steady state  $\{\mu_i,\lambda_i,x_i,\rho_i\}^{N}_{i=2}$ and $\{\tau(s)\}_s$
are determined by  the following equations:
\begin{subequations}
\label{sys-steadystate}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ss.imp.simplified}
  	Z_i(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s) + x_i = \frac{\beta^{-1}P(s)x_i U^i_c(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)}{\mathbb{E} U^i_c(\tau,\rho)}\text{   for all  $s,i \geq 2$,}\\
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
	U_{\tau}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)-\sum_i\mu_i Z_{i,\tau}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)  =0 \text{  for all $s$,} \label{eq:foc.tau.simplified}\\
   \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
	U_{\rho_i}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s) -\sum_j\mu_jZ_{j,\rho_i}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)+ \lambda_iP(s)U^I_c(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)-\lambda_i\beta\mathbb{E}P(s)U^I_c(\tau(s),\bm \rho(s),s) =0. \text{   for all $s,i < I$ }\label{eq:foc.R.simplified}
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
When the shock $s$ takes only two values, \eqref{sys-steadystate} is a square system of $4(I-1)+2$ equations in $4(I-1)+2$ unknowns $\{\mu^{SS}_i,\lambda^{SS}_i,x^{SS}_i,\rho^{SS}_i\}^{I-1}_{i=1}$ and $\{\tau^{SS}(s)\}_{s}$. For $|S|\geq 3$,
there are more equations than unknowns. %So even if one can satisfy them for a given set of parameters, a generic solution does not exist.
\end{proof}
%\textbf{XXX Tom and David: Lets discuss this and see if we can make it more precise. }

\color{black}

Lemma \ref{lemma-simplified-foc} also highlights the tradeoffs that the planner faces.  Defining $\tilde{\lambda}=-\lambda \mathbb{E}P U^i_c(\tau,\bm \rho)$ and taking expectations in equation (\ref{eq:foc.R.simplified}), we get
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.ss.tradeoffs}
\mathbb{E} U_{\rho_i}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)= \mathbb{E} \sum_j\mu_j(s)Z_{j,\rho_i}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s) + (1-\mathbb{E}\beta(s))\tilde{\lambda_i}
\end{equation}
The multiplier on the implementability constraint for $i$ can be interpreted as the marginal cost of extracting funds from $i$  and $\tilde{\lambda_i}$ is proportional to the multiplier on the constraint $\frac{\mathbb{E}P\bm{U}^i_c}{\mathbb{E}P \bm{U}^{I}_c}=\rho$. This constraint ensures that at the optimal allocation, agent $i$ has no  incentive to change his bond portfolio. The left side of \eqref{eq.ss.tradeoffs} captures the cost for the planner if inequality (measured by the ratios of marginal utilities of consumption) deviates from his ideal point, given by $\alpha_1/\alpha_i$. In the absence of any constraints, at the first best the planner would set $\mathbb{E} U_{\rho_i}(\tau(s),\bm \rho,s)=0$, which implies that $\alpha_i U^i_c = \alpha_1 U^1_c$ for all $i$. The right  side of equation \eqref{eq.ss.tradeoffs} captures the cost of approaching the planner's ideal point, which come from the costs of raising taxes (the first term on the left hand side) and the ability of
agents to trade (the second term).

At a steady state, outcomes resemble those in  the complete market economy of \citet{Wer07a}.
The tax rate  and transfers both depend only on the current realization of shock $s_t$.\footnote{However we note that the steady state distribution of assets is endogenous, and depends on the technology and preference parameters, as against in \citet{Wer07a} where it is pinned down by the initial distribution of assets.}
%Furthermore,
Arguments of \citeauthor{Wer07a} can be adapted  to show that the tax rate is
constant when preferences have the CES form $c^{1-\sigma}/(1-\sigma) - l^{1+\gamma}/(1-\gamma) $,  and also that fluctuations in the tax rate
are very small when preferences take forms consistent with the existence of  balanced growth.
%\textbf{Tom XXXXXX: check and flag and rewrite.} We return to this point  after we discuss convergence to a steady state.


\subsection{A two-agent example}\label{sec: 2 agent example}


%To
%verify existence of a steady state for a particular set of  parameter values requires checking that there exists a solution of system (\ref{sys-steadystate}).
Since  (\ref{sys-steadystate}) is a non-linear system, in general existence of a solution can   be verified only numerically.
      Here we provide a simple example with risk averse agents in which the existence of a root of (\ref{sys-steadystate}) can be established analytically. This example will allow us to identify forces also present in the quasilinear economy
of section \ref{Sec: quasilinear} and  the more general economies to be analyzed with numerical methods in section \ref{sec: numerical results}.

Consider an economy consisting of  two types of households with $%
\theta _{1,t}>\theta _{2,t}=0$ and common one-period utilities  $\ln c-\frac{1}{2}%
l^{2}.$ The shock $s$  takes  two values$ \left\{
s_{L},s_{H}\right\} $ that are i.i.d across time.  We assume that $g\left( s\right) =g$ for all $s,$
and $\theta _{1}\left( s_{H}\right) >\theta _{1}\left( s_{L}\right) .$\footnote{The restriction that expenditures are constant and productivities are stochastic can be relaxed and we obtain very similar results}
\smallskip

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm long run forces}\smallskip Suppose that $g<\theta (s)$ for all $%
s.$ Let $R(s|s\_)$ be the return on the traded asset.

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Countercyclical returns.} If $P \left( s_{H}\right) =P\left( s_{L}\right)$, then
there exists a steady state in which
$B^{SS}(s)>0,\ R^{SS}\left( s_{H}\right|s\_) <R^{SS}\left( s_{L}|s\_\right) .$
\item \textbf{Procyclical interest rate.} There exists a pair  $\left\{ P \left( s_{H}\right) ,P\left( s_{L}\right)
\right\} $ implying a steady state with $B^{SS}(s)<0$ and  $R^{SS}\left( s_{H}|s\_\right) >R^{SS}\left( s_{L}|s\_\right) .$
\end{enumerate}
In both cases, the tax rate $\tau(s)=\tau^{SS}$ is independent of $s$.
\end{theorem}



Normalizing the assets of the unproductive agent to zero %\footnote{Which theorem \ref{theorem: main} again  tells us amounts only to  a normalization.}
let us  interpret $B$ as the government's assets.
%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: please check the previous important sentence which I edited
%and may have degraded.}
Besides establishing existence of a steady state, Theorem \ref{thm long run forces}
isolates the procyclical or countercyclical comovement of the return on the asset as a predictor of  the sign of government assets under a Ramsey plan.

Theorem \ref{thm long run forces}  points to fluctuations in inequality and fluctuations in the return on the asset as two main forces governing  determine the dynamics of the  tax rate
and the government's stock of the asset. If the  asset return process were constant, in response  to an adverse  shock in the form of a fall in $\theta_1$
the government could either increase the  tax rate $%
\tau $ or it could decrease transfers $T.$ Both  responses are distorting,
but for different reasons. Increasing the tax rate increases distortions because the deadweight loss is convex in the tax rate,
 as in \cite{Barro1979}. The Ramsey planner copes with this distortion  %in the present economy
  in the same way that it does in  representative agent economies, namely, by trying to smooth the distorting tax rate.
 \color{black}
 But in a  heterogeneous agent economy like ours,  adjusting transfers $T$ is
also costly. Starting from $B=0$ (which means that    agents' asset holdings are identical  because we normalized by setting $b_2=0$),
a decrease in transfers  disproportionately adversely
affects a low-skilled agent, so his marginal utility
falls by more than does the marginal utility of a high-skilled agent. Consequently, a
decrease in transfers increases inequality, giving rise to a cost  not present in a representative agent economy.
%\textbf{Tom XXXXX: flag link to quasilinear subsection.}

The government can reduce the costs of  attaining its objectives about  redistribution  by choosing
tax rate policies that make the net assets of  the high-skilled agent
decrease over time. That makes the two agents'
after-tax and after-interest income  become closer, allowing decreases in transfers to have smaller effects on inequality in
marginal utilities. If the net asset position of a high-skilled agent is
sufficiently low, then a change in transfers has no effect on inequality and
all  distortions from fluctuations in transfers are eliminated.\footnote{This convergence outcome has
 a similar flavor to "back-loading"\ results  of
 \cite{Ray2002} and \cite{Albanesi2012} that recommend structuring policies intertemporally eventually to disarm  distortions.} This pushes $B$ to be positive in the long run.




%
% If consumption is ordered i.e it is higher in booms than in recessions, interest rates are countercyclical. The government will hold positive assets as long as the steady state marginal utility adjusted primary deficit$Z(\tau,\rho,s)$ is countercyclical too.

% It is possible to show numerically\footnote{Appendix \ref{apndx: numerical methods} describes a numerical test for existence and local stability cast in terms of  primitives.} that the steady state described in part
% 2 of  proposition \ref{thm long run forces} is stable, so the  economy converges to it. This convergence outcome has
% a similar flavor to "back-loading"\ results  of
% \cite{Ray2002} and \cite{Albanesi2012} that reflect the  optimality of structuring policies intertemporally eventually to disarm  distortions.

% Theorem \ref{theorem: main} provides  a useful way to compare our results with
%  representative agent economies. By that theorem, we can normalize $%
% b_{2,t}=0 $ for all $t$, in which case the negative of net assets of high-skilled agents can be
% interpreted as assets of the government. Because $x^{SS}>0,$
% the government  accumulates assets over time$,$ as in  AMSS.

% the government  accumulates assets over time$,$ as in  AMSS.

 Turning now to the second force, the return on the asset  generally fluctuates
 with  shocks.  Parts 1 and 2 of  Theorem \ref{thm long run forces} isolate forces that  drive those  fluctuations.
 Consider again the example of a
 decrease in the productivity of high-skilled agents. If the  tax rate  $\tau $ is left unchanged,
 %the government faces a shortfall of revenues. Since
 since $g$ is constant, the
 government requires  extra revenues. But  suppose that
 the return on the asset increases whenever $\theta_1 $ decreases, as happens, for
 example in part 1 of Theorem \ref{thm long run forces} with a risk free bond. If the government holds positive assets, its earnings from those assets increase.
 So holding assets allows higher income from assets  to offset some of the government's revenue losses from taxes on labor.
 The situation reverses if the return on the asset falls at
 times of increased need for government revenues coming from higher net-of interest deficits, as in
  part 2 of  Theorem \ref{thm long run forces}, so the steady state sees the government's owing debt.

In the  long run, the government's  debt depends on the balance of the two forces: (1) inequality
distortions  push the government asset position $B$ to be positive,  and (2)  hedging motives that can also push $B$ positive  as in part 1  Theorem \ref{thm long run forces},
 but that for sufficiently procylical returns can
push   government assets $B$ to be negative in the long run as in part 2 of the theorem.
\color{black}

  These outcomes have  counterparts in  the representative agent quasilinear economy studied in section \ref{Sec: quasilinear}.
  There, quasilinearity  of preferences allowed us to characterize how the covariance of the asset returns
  and  exogenous shocks affected the sign (and level) of government assets through expression \eqref{ss-debt}.
  In parts 1 and 2 of Theorem \ref{thm long run forces}, with binary shocks,  altering the gap $P(s_H)-P(s_L)$ implies  a
  such  variation in asset returns. Despite the endogeneity of the key covariance in the model of this section,
  the  underlying forces remain those prevailing more immediately in section \ref{Sec: quasilinear}.



\subsection{Stability}\label{sec:stability}
To say some things about the long-run behavior of government debt   in more general  economies, we now apply an extension of  the Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}  approximation method.
  In the quasilinear case, we  obtained an analytical characterization.  Here,
for more general specifications, we use a numerical  convergence criterion to  establish local stability of a steady state over a range of parameter values for economies with binary i.i.d aggregate shocks and arbitrary number of agents who have concave utility in consumption. 


As before, let $\pi(s)\mu_i(s)$ and $\lambda_i$ be Lagrange multipliers on constraints (\ref{eq:ss-imp}) and (\ref{eq:bondcondtion}), respectively.
In appendix \ref{apndx: numerical methods} we show that the history-dependent Ramsey policies
(they are sequences of functions of $s^t$) can be represented  recursively in terms of $\{\bm \mu(s^{t-1}),\bm \rho(s^{t-1})\}$ and $s_t$.
A recursive representation of an optimal policy can be linearized around  steady state values of the state
variables  $(\bm{\mu},\bm{\rho})$.\footnote{One could  in principle look for a solution in state variables $\left(\bm{x}(s^{t-1}),\bm{\rho}(s^{t-1})\right)$.
For $I=2$ with $\{\theta_i(s)\}$ different across agents, this would give identical policies and a map that is (locally) invertible between $\bm{x}$ and $\bm{\mu}$ for
a given $\bm{\rho}$. However in other cases, it turns out there are unique linear policies in $(\bm{\mu},\bm{\rho}
)$ and not necessarily in  $(\bm{x},\bm{\rho})$. This comes from the fact that the set of feasible $(\bm{x},\bm{\rho})$ are restricted at time 0 and may not contain an open set around the steady state values. When we linearize using $(\bm{\mu},\bm{\rho})$ as state variables, the optimal policies for $\bm{x}(s^t),\bm{\rho}(s^t)$ converge to their  steady state levels for all perturbations in $(\bm{\mu},\bm{\rho})$.}
Let $\hat{\Psi}_{t}= \left[\bmat \bm{\mu}_{t} - \bm{\mu}^{SS}\\ \bm \rho_t - \bm \rho^{SS}\emat\right]$ be  deviations from a steady state.
Construct a  linear approximation
\begin{equation}
 \hat{\Psi}_{t+1}=C(s_{t+1})\hat{\Psi}_t \label{eq.linear.lom}
\end{equation}
whose coefficients $C(s)$   are functions of the shock $s$. Let $\mathbb{E}C(s)$  be the mathematical expectation of  $C(s)$. The next theorem describes features of $\mathbb{E}C(s)$ that control whether  this linear system converges to zero in probability.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm: localstability}
If the (real parts) of the eigenvalues of $\mathbb{E}C(s)$ are less than 1,  system (\ref{eq.linear.lom}) converges to zero  in mean.
For large $t$, the conditional variance of $\hat{\Psi}$, denoted by $\Sigma_{\Psi,t}$, is governed by
\[\text{vec}(\Sigma_{\Psi,t})=\widehat{C} \text{vec}(\Sigma_{\Psi,t-1}),\]	
where $\widehat{C}$ is a $(2I-2) \times (2I-2)$ matrix. In addition,  if the (real parts) of the eigenvalues of $\widehat{C}$ are less than 1, system \eqref{eq.linear.lom}
converges in probability.
\end{theorem}

The dominant  eigenvalue of $\mathbb{E}C(s)$ is informative not only about whether the system is locally stable but also about  the rate at which the steady state is approached.
The half-life of convergence to the steady state is  $\frac{\log(0.5)}{\|\iota\|}$, where $\|\iota\|$ is the absolute value of the dominant eigenvalue.
%Thus, the closer the dominant eigenvalue is to one, the slower is the speed of convergence.

In work described in appendix \ref{apndx: stability}, we have applied  Theorem \ref{thm: localstability} to verify local stability for many examples.
%Since the parameter space is high dimensional, we relegate the comparative statics to .
\color{black}
The typical finding there  is that the steady state is stable but that convergence is slow.
The rates of convergence are increasing in the strength of covariance of the return on the asset and aggregate shocks
that affect the net-of-interest government deficit. We return to this feature when we study low frequency components of the Ramsey allocation for the quantitative example to be studied in section \ref{sec: numerical results}.










\section{Numerical example}
\label{sec: numerical results}
In sections \ref{Sec: quasilinear} and \ref{Sec: more general economies},
we studied steady states as a way of summarizing the asymptotic  behavior of Ramsey allocations and the forces that shape  the asymptotic distribution of government and private assets.
In this section, we use a calibrated version of the economy  a) to revisit the magnitude of these forces; and  b) to study optimal policy responses
at business cycle frequencies when the economy is possibly far away from a (stochastic) steady state.
We choose shocks and initial conditions to match stylized facts from the  recent
recession in US. The numerical calculations use methods adapted from \cite{Evans2014}
%\textbf{Anmol and David -- let's add Evans (2014) properly to the *.bib file please.}
and described  in the appendix \ref{appndx: numerical appendix}. %The next section describes how we set  parameters and initial conditions.



\subsection{Calibration}

We assume  five types of agents of equal measures with preferences $u(c,l)=\frac{c^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}-\frac{l^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}$.
These agents stand in for  the $90\textsuperscript{th},75\textsuperscript{th},50\textsuperscript{th},25\textsuperscript{th},  \text{and } 10\textsuperscript{th}$ quantiles
of the  US wage distribution.\footnote{Setting  $I=5$ allows us ample heterogeneity in wealth and earnings. We have verified that the main qualitative and quantitative insights are unchanged when  we
have more than five types.
Our equilibrium approximation method is practical with a much larger  number of types than 5. }

Let $\mathcal{Q}(i)$ be the quantile of agent $i$. We assume i.i.d aggregate shocks $\epsilon_t$ that affect both the labor productivities of all agents $\{\theta_{i,t}\}^{I}_{i=1}$ and the  payoff $p_t$ of the single asset:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation} \label{wage equation calibration}
 \log \theta_{i,t}=\log\bar{\theta_i}+ \epsilon_t[1+(.9-\mathcal{Q}(i))m]
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
p_t=1+\chi \epsilon_t

Following \cite{Autor2008},we set average productivities $\{\bar{\theta_i}\}^{N}_{i=1}$  to match
quantiles of  average weekly earnings of full time wage and salary earners from the Current Population Survey (CPS).

The parameter $m$ allows us to generate recessions associated with different  falls in income for different types of agents.
We calibrate $m$ to match  facts reported by \citet{Fatih2014}.
Figure \ref{fig:fatih_picture} (adapted from \citeauthor{Fatih2014}) reports that in the latest US recession the fall in income for  agents in the first decile of earnings was about  three times
that experienced by the 90th percentile. Furthermore, between the 10th and the 90th  percentiles, the change in the percentage drop in earnings was almost linear.
From these facts we infer a slope  $m=\frac{1.5}{0.8}$.

The parameter $\chi$ captures the ex-post comovement in returns on government assets  and aggregate shocks.
Our model is silent about the source of these comovements. In the data,  they could
compe from variations in real payoffs due inflation, interest rate risk for longer maturity bonds,  or defaults.
For the purpose of our numerical exercise, we use US data on inflation and interest rates of longer maturities bonds to calibrate $\chi$.
We calibrate the comovement in the following way.
Let $q^{(n)}_t$ be the log price of a nominal bond of maturity $n$. We can define  real holding period returns $r^{(n)}_{t,t+1}$ as

 \[r^{(n)}_{t,t+1}= q^{(n-1)}_{t+1}-q_t^{(n)}-\pi_{t+1}\]
 With the transfromation $y^{(n)}_t: -\frac{1}{n} q^{(n)}_t$ we can express $r^{(n)}_{t,t+1}$ as follows:
 \[r^{(n)}_{t,t+1}=\underbrace{y^{(n)}_t}_{\text{Ex-ante part}} - (n-1)\left[\underbrace{\left(y^{(n)}_{t+1}-y^{(n)}_{t}\right)}_{\text{Interest rate risk given $n$}}+\underbrace{\left(y^{(n-1)}_{t+1}-y^{(n)}_{t+1}\right)}_{\text{Term structure risk}}\right]-\underbrace{\pi_{t+1}}_{\text{Inflation risk}}\]

 In our model, the holding period returns are given by $\log\left[\frac{p_{t+1}}{q_{t}}\right]$ and $q_t=\frac{\beta \mathbb{E}_tu_{c,t+1}P_{t+1}}{u_{c,t}}$. Note that $p_{t+1}$ allows us to captures ex-post fluctuations in returns to the government's debt  portfolio coming from maturity and inflation.



Table \ref{tab:corr} summarizes the comovement between labor productivity $\{\epsilon_t\}$ and bond prices $\{q^{n}_t\}$ for different maturities inferred from  quarterly US data for the period 1952 to 2003.
% \textbf{Anmol XXXXXX: a latex problem -- the automatic numbering of the table seems mixed up. See table and above sentence.}
The table's first line reports the correlation between the ex post returns and labor productivities.
In our baseline calibration, $\epsilon_{t}$ is i.i.d over time. Hence the parameter $\chi=\frac{\sigma_{r}}{\sigma_{\epsilon}} Corr(r,\epsilon)$.
By averaging over different maturities we infer a value of $\chi=-0.06$.\footnote{The  second line of table \ref{tab:corr} computes
 the correlation of labor productivity with the  ex-post component of returns.
For the shortest maturity, 3 month real tbill returns $ Corr(\epsilon_{t+1},y^{1 qtr}_{t}-\pi_{t+1})=-0.11$. These results together give us a
range for $\chi$ of zero to negative $-0.09$. The numerical results are not sensitive to values of $\chi$ is this range.} Thus,
payoffs are weakly countercyclical for US. Besides the results for the benchmark value of $\chi=-0.06$,
the long simulations in  section \ref{sec:longrunsimul} include outcomes for a  range of $\chi$'s from $-1.0$ to $1.0$.

 As for  parameters of  household preferences, we set $\sigma=1$, $\gamma=2$, which imply Frisch elasticity of labor supply of $0.5$.
 We set the time discount factor $\beta=0.98$, which implies  the annual interest rate in an economy without shocks would be $2\%$ per year.

 We assume that the initial wealth is perfectly correlated with wages and calibrate the wealth distribution to get the relative quantiles as in \cite{Kuhn2014} and \cite{QuadriniRull2014}. %\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: let's add appropriate reference to the *.bib file please.}
 These papers document the quantiles of net worth for US households computed up to 2010 Survey of Consumer Finances.

 For the Pareto weights and government expenditures, we use an optimal allocation in an economy without shocks to target a (pre-transfers, federal) expenditure output ratio of $12\%$,
 a tax rate of $23\%$, a ratio of transfers to gdp of $10\%$, and a government debt to gdp of $100\%$.

\subsection{Long run outcomes}\label{sec:longrunsimul}
Figure \ref{fig:long_simulation} simulations of  2000 periods for the government debt to output ratio, the labor tax rate,  and the transfers to output ratio
for three values of $\chi \in \{-1.0,-0.06,1.0\}$ in red, black, and blue, respectively. The three simulations start from the  same initial conditions and
all share the same sequence of underlying shocks.

 {
  \begin{figure}
  \label{fig:long_simulation}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{cesplots/long_simulation_debt.png}
    \caption{The red, black and blue lines plot simulations for a common sequence of shocks for values of $\chi=-1.0,-0.06,1.0$ respectively}
  \end{figure}

}

Two features emerge.   Different values $\chi$ give rise to different locations of the long-run marginal distribution of government assets and also to different  rates  of convergence
to that long-run distribution.
A sufficiently positive $\chi$ generates lower payoffs in recessions relative to booms. In line with assertions of  theorems \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} and  \ref{thm long run forces},
we see from the blue line  that  the government does not repay its initial debt during these 2000 periods. On the other
hand, under the benchmark $\chi$  (black line) or  when $\chi$ is negative (red line), the government accumulates assets.

In order to get a clearer picture of the speed of convergence, we plot  paths of the conditional means for debt and the  tax rate in figure \ref{fig:speed_of_convergence}.
To explain how we generated these plots, let $B(s_{t+1},\bm x_t, \bm \rho_t)$ be the Ramsey decision rules
that generate the assets $B$ of the government and let $\Psi \left( s_{t+1};\bm{x}_t,\bm{\rho }_t\right)$ be the law of motion for the state variables for the Ramsey plan.
For a given history, the conditional mean of government assets is:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
B^{cm}_{t+1}=\mathbb{E}B(s_{t+1},\bm x^{cm}_t,\bm \rho^{cm}_{t})
\end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
 \bm x^{cm}_t,\bm \rho^{cm}_{t}=\mathbb{E}\Psi (s_{t}, \bm x^{cm}_{t-1},\bm \rho^{cm}_{t-1})
 \end{equation}
\end{subequations}
Note how these conditional mean  paths smooth the high frequency movements in the dynamics of the state variables but retain the low frequency drifts.
 As before,  different lines correspond to  different values of $\chi$ between $-1.0$ and $1.0$ with the blue (red) lines representing positive (negative) values of $\chi$.
 Thicker  lines depict outcomes associated with larger values of $\chi$. The figure  shows that the speed of convergence is increasing and the magnitude of the limiting assets in decreasing
 in the strength of correlation between productivities and payoffs. This pattern  confirms the approximation results characterized in Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}.

 {
  \begin{figure}
  \label{fig:speed_of_convergence}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width = .9\textwidth]{cesplots/speed_of_convergence.png}
    \caption{The plot shows conditional mean paths for different values of $\chi$. The red (blue) lines have $\chi<0$ ($\chi>0$). The thicker lines represent larger values.}
  \end{figure}

}


To verify the wide support of the ergodic distributions,
we take the initial conditions at the end of the long simulation and subject the economy to a sequence of 100 periods of $\epsilon_t$ shocks that  are 2 standard deviations below the mean.  In figure \ref{fig: wide support of taxes} we see that given a sufficiently long sequence of negative productivity  shocks the economy will eventually deviate significantly from its ergodic mean.


{

    \caption{Taxes for a sequence of -1 s.d shocks to aggregate productivity of length 100}
  \end{figure}

}

A further inference from the analysis of earlier sections was that government assets $B$  in the steady state are decreasing in the redistributive motive of the government.
We check this numerically here  by changing  Pareto weights.
We parametrize the redistributive motive using  $\alpha$.  The planner places evenly spaced Pareto weights from $0.2+\alpha$
on the lowest productivity agent to $0.2-\alpha$ on the highest productivity agent. Increasing $\alpha$ lowers concerns for redistribution.
In figure \ref{fig: comp_stats_alpha} we plot mean of the government assets in the ergodic distribution as a function of $\alpha$ and validate that higher values of $\alpha$ are associated with larger values long run government assets.

    \caption{This plot shows long run assets of the government as a function of $\alpha$ which parametrizes the redistributive concern. Higher $\alpha$ represent planner's with relatively higher weights on productive agents.}
  \end{figure}

}




\subsection{Short run}
The analysis of the previous subsection studied  very low
frequency components of  a Ramsey plan. Here  we focus on business cycle frequencies.
 In our setting,  these higher frequency responses can conveniently be classified  in terms of  magnitudes of changes as we switch from ``boom''
to ``recession,'' and the dynamics during  periods when a recession or boom state persists. A recession is a negative $-1.0$ standard deviation realization for the $\epsilon_t$ process. Given the initial conditions and the benchmark calibration, the plots below trace the paths
for debt, the tax rate,  and transfers for a sequence of shocks that feature a recession of four periods from $t=3$. Before and after this recession, the economy receives $\epsilon_t=0$.

The main exercise here is to compute how the Ramsey tax rate, transfers, and government debt in recessions accompanied by larger inequality differ from those
in a recession that affects all agents alike. Under the benchmark calibration, log wages for agent $i$
are given by $\log \theta_i=\log \overline{\theta}_i+\epsilon [1+(.9-\mathcal{Q}(i))m]$. We decompose the total responses into a
 TFP only component by setting $m=0$ and an inequality only component as follows:

\begin{equation*}
\log \theta^{tfp}_i=\log \overline{\theta}_i+\epsilon
\end{equation*}

\begin{equation*}
 \log \theta^{ineq}_i=\log \overline{\theta}_i+\epsilon [(.9-\mathcal{Q}(i))m]
\end{equation*}

Figure \ref{fig: irf} plots impulse responses. The shaded region is the induced recession and the bold line captures the benchmark (total) response. The dashed (dotted) line
reflects the TFP only  (inequality) effect.
In the benchmark, the government responds to an adverse shock by a making big increases in transfers, the  tax rate, and  government debt. However, without inequality shocks (dotted line), the government
responds by decreasing transfers and  increasing both debt and
the tax rate, but by  amounts an order of magnitude smaller than in the benchmark.

    \caption{The bold line is the total response. The dashed (dotted) line reflects the only TFP (inequality) effect. The shaded region is the recession}
  \end{figure}

}
Next we average over sample paths of length 100 periods and report the volatility, autocorrelation, and correlation with exogenous shocks for the  tax rate
and transfers in table \ref{tab:sample moments}. We see that taxes are twice as volatile and that the correlation between transfers and productivities switches sign.
This  indicates how ignoring redistributive goals affect  prescriptions for government
policy in recessions.

\subsection{Extension: Borrowing constraints}

%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I have removed theorem 2 and addeda mention that the corollary to theorem 1 is valid under adhoc borrowing constraints too. We dont have anything more to say about it. }
%
%\textcolor{blue}{Anmol : I have attempted to re-write the appendix in a way that it is self-contained. The earlier one had forward references and missing arguments.}

Representative agent models  rule out  Ricardian equivalence
either  by assuming distorting taxes or by imposing ad hoc borrowing constraints. %In section \ref{sec:Ricardian101},
By way of contrast, we have verified that Ricardian equivalence holds in our economy even though
there are distorting taxes. % are typically part of an optimal equilibrium.
Imposing ad-hoc borrowing limits also leaves Ricardian equivalence intact in our economy.\footnote{%
\citet{Bryant1984} describe how a government can use borrowing
constraints as part of a welfare-improving policy to finance exogenous
government expenditures. \citet{Sargent1987} describe Modigliani-Miller
theorems for government finance in a collection of economies in which
borrowing constraints on classes of agents produce the kind of rate of
return discrepancies that Bryant and Wallace manipulate.} In economies with
exogenous borrowing constraints, agents' maximization problems  include the
additional constraints
\begin{equation}
b_{i,t}\geq \underline{b}_{i}  \label{borrowing constraint}
\end{equation}%
for some exogenously given $\left\{ \underline{b}_{i}\right\} _{i}.$ %We
%define an equilibrium similarly to Definition \ref{Def: CE with affine taxes}%
\begin{definition}
\label{Def: CE with affine taxes borrowing constraints}For given $\left(
\left \{ b_{i,-1},\underline{b}_{i}\right \} _{i},B_{-1}\right) $ and $%
\left
\{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \} _{t},$ a competitive equilibrium with
affine taxes and exogenous borrowing constraints is a sequence $\{ \left \{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i},B_{t},R_{t}\}_{t} $ such that $%
\left
\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \} _{i,t}$ maximizes (\ref{utility
lifetime})\ subject to (\ref{agent bc affine}) and (\ref{borrowing
constraint}), $\{ b_{i,t} \}_{i,t}$ are bounded,
and constraints (\ref{feasibility goods}), (\ref{govmt bc affine})\ and (\ref%
{feasibility bonds})\ are satisfied.
\end{definition}

We can define an \emph{optimal} competitive equilibrium with exogenous borrowing
constraints by extending Definition \ref{Def: optimal CE affine}.

%The role of the initial distribution of assets  is
%unaffected by the introduction of the ad-hoc debt limits and  so is Corollary  \ref{corr: B does not matter}.
The introduction of the ad-hoc debt limits leaves unaltered the conclusions of  Corollary  \ref{corr: B does not matter} and
the role of the initial distribution of assets across agents.
 The next theorem asserts
that ad-hoc borrowing limits do not limit a government's ability to respond to
aggregate shocks.\footnote{%
See \citet{Yared2012,Yared2013}  who shows a closely related result.}
\smallskip

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:borrowing_constraint}  Given an initial asset distribution $\left(
\left\{ b_{i,-1}\right\} _{i},B_{-1}\right)$, let $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ and $\left\{ R_{t}\right\}_t $ be a competitive
equilibrium allocation and interest rate sequence in an economy without
exogenous borrowing constraints. Then for any exogenous
constraints $\left\{ \underline{b}_{i}\right\} _{i}$, there is a government
tax policy $\left\{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right\} _{t}$ such that $\left\{
c_{i,t},l_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is a competitive equilibrium
allocation in an economy with exogenous borrowing constraints $\left(
\left\{ b_{i,-1},\underline{b}_{i}\right\} _{i},B_{-1}\right) $ and $\left\{
\tau _{t},T_{t}\right\} _{t}.$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Let $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$
be a competitive equilibrium allocation without exogenous borrowing
constraints. Let $\Delta _{t}\equiv \max_{i}\left\{ \underline{b}%
_{i}-b_{i,t}\right\} .$ Define $\hat{b}_{i,t}\equiv b_{i,t}+\Delta _{t}$ \ for all $t\geq 0$ and $\hat{b}_{i,-1}=b_{-1}.$ By Theorem %
\ref{theorem: main}, $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}%
_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is also a competitive equilibrium allocation without
exogenous borrowing constraints. Moreover, by construction $\hat{b}_{i,t}-%
\underline{b}_{i}=b_{i,t}+\Delta _{t}-\underline{b}_{i}\geq 0$.
Therefore, $\hat{b}_{i,t}$ satisfies (\ref{borrowing constraint}). Since
agents' budget sets are smaller in the economy with exogenous borrowing
constraints, and $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}%
_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ are feasible at interest rate process $\left\{
R_{t}\right\} _{t}$, then $\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},%
\hat{b}_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is also an optimal choice for agents in the
economy with exogenous borrowing constraints $\left\{ \underline{b}%
_{i}\right\} _{i}.$ Since all market clearing conditions are satisfied, $%
\left\{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right\} _{i,t}$ is a
competitive equilibrium allocation and asset profile.
\end{proof}

To provide some intuition for Theorem \ref{thm:borrowing_constraint}, suppose to the contrary that the exogenous borrowing constraints  restricted a  government's
 ability to achieve a desired allocation. That  means that
the government would want to increase  its borrowing
and to repay agents later, which the borrowing constraints prevent. But the government can just reduce
transfers today and increase them tomorrow. That would  achieve the  desired  allocation
without violating the exogenous borrowing constraints.

Welfare can  be strictly higher in an economy  with exogenous
borrowing constraints  relative to an economy without borrowing constraints because  a government might want to
push some agents against their borrowing limits. When agents' borrowing
constraints bind, their shadow interest rates differ from the
common interest rate that unconstrained agents face. When the government rearranges tax
policies to  affect the  interest rate, it affects constrained and unconstrained agents
 differently.  By facilitating
redistribution, this can improve welfare. %In the next several paragraphs, we will formalize this
%intuition.
We next construct an example without any
shocks in which the government can achieve higher welfare by using borrowing
constraints to improve its ability to redistribute.
In this section we construct an example in which the government can achieve
higher welfare in the economy with ad-hoc borrowing limits. We restrict ourselves to a deterministic economy with $g_t=0$, $\beta_t=\beta$ and $I=2$.  Further the utility function over consumption and labor supply $U(c,l)$ is separable in the arguments and satisfies the Inada conditions. The  planners problem can then be written as the following sequence problem
\begin{equation}
	\max_{\{c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t},R_t\}_t} \sum_{t=0}^\infty\beta^t\left[\alpha_1U(c_{1,t},l_{1,t}) +\alpha_2 U(c_{2,t},l_{2,t})\right]\label{eq.A_obj}
\end{equation}subject to
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	c_{2,t}+\frac{U_{l2,t}l_{2,t}}{U_{c2,t}}-\left(c_{1,t}+\frac{U_{l1,t}l_{1,t}}{U_{c1,t}}\right) +\frac{1}{R_t}\left( b_{2,t}-b_{1,t}\right)  = b_{2,t-1}-b_{1,t-1}\label{eq.A_imp}\\
	\frac{U_{l1,t}}{\theta_1U_{c1,t}} = \frac{U_{l2,t}}{\theta_2 U_{c2,t}}\label{eq.A_wage}\\
	c_{1,t}+c_{2,t} \leq \theta_1 l_{1,t}+\theta_2 l_{2,t}\label{eq.A_feas}\\
	\left(\frac{U_{ci,t}}{U_{ci,t+1}}-\beta R_t\right)(b_{i,t}-\underline b_i) = 0\label{eq.A_slack}\\
	\frac{U_{ci,t}}{U_{ci,t+1}} \geq \beta R_t\label{eq.A_euler}\\
	b_{i,t}\geq \underline b_i
\end{align}
\end{subequations}  Where $\underline b_i$ is the exogenous borrowing constraint for agent i.  We obtain equation \eqref{eq.A_imp} by eliminating transfers from the budget equations of the households and using the optimality for labor supply decision. Equations \eqref{eq.A_slack} and \eqref{eq.A_euler} capture the inter-temporal optimality conditions modified for possbily binding constraints.

Let $c^{fb}_i$ and $l^{fb}_i$ be the allocation that solves the first best problem, that is maximizing equation \eqref{eq.A_obj} subject to \eqref{eq.A_feas}, and define
\begin{equation}
	Z^{fb}  = c_{2}^{fb}+\frac{U_{l2}^{fb}l_{2}^{fb}}{U_{c2}^{fb}}-\left(c_{1}^{fb}+\frac{U_{l1}^{fb}l_{1}^{fb}}{U_{c1}^{fb}}\right)
\end{equation}and
\begin{equation}
	\tilde b_2^{fb} = \frac{Z^{fb}}{\frac1\beta -1}
\end{equation}  We will assume that the exogenous borrowing constraints satisfy $\underline b_2 = \underline b_1 + \tilde b_2^{fb}$.  We then have the following lemma

\begin{lemma}  If $\tilde b_2^{fb}>(<)0$ and $b_{2,-1}-b_{1,-1} > (<) \tilde b_2^{fb}$ then the planner can implement the first best.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We will consider the candidate allocation where $c_{i,t} = c^{fb}_i$, $l_{i,t} = l^{fb}_i$, $b_{i,t} = \underline b_i$ and interest rates are given by $R_t = \frac 1{\beta}$ for $t\geq 1$.  It should be clear then that equations \eqref{eq.A_wage} and \eqref{eq.A_feas} are satisfied as a property of the first best allocation.  Equation \eqref{eq.A_slack} is trivially satisfied since the agents are at their borrowing constraints.  For $t\geq 1$ equations \eqref{eq.A_imp} and \eqref{eq.A_euler} are both satisfied by the choice of $R_t = \frac1\beta$ and the first best allocations.  It remains to check that equation \eqref{eq.A_imp} is satisfied at time $t=0$ for an interest rate $R_0 <\frac1\beta$.  At time zero the constraint is give by
\begin{equation}
	Z^{fb} + \frac 1{R_0} \tilde b^{fb}_2 = b_{2,-1}-b_{1,-1}
\end{equation}  The assumption that $b_{2,-1}-b_{1,-1} > (<) \tilde b_2^{fb}$ if  $\tilde b_2^{fb}>(<)0$ then implies that
\[
	R_ 0 = \frac{\tilde b^{fb}_2}{b_{2,-1}-b_{1,-1}- Z^{fb}} <\frac 1\beta
\] as desired.
\end{proof}

This will improve upon the planners problem without exogenous borrowing constraints, as first best can only be achieved in this scenario when $b_{2,-1}-b_{1,-1} = \tilde b_2^{fb}$.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{theorem: main}}
\label{appndx: thm RE}
 \begin{proof}
 Let
 \begin{equation}
 \hat{T}_{t}=T_{t} + \left(\hat{b}_{1,t} - b_{1,t}\right) -
 R_{t-1}\left(\hat{b}_{1,t-1} - b_{1,t-1}\right) \text{ for
 all }t\geq 0.  \label{construct That}
 \end{equation}%
 Given  a tax policy $\left \{ \tau _{t},\hat{T}_{t}\right \} _{t},$ the
 allocation $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}_{i,t}$ is a feasible choice for consumer $i$ since it satisfies%
 \begin{eqnarray*}
 c_{i,t}&=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}b_{i,t-1}-b_{i,t}+T_{t}\\
 &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\left( b_{i,t-1}-b_{1,t-1}\right) -\left(
 b_{i,t}-b_{1,t}\right) +T_{t}+R_{t-1}b_{1,t-1}-b_{1,t} \\
 &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\left( \hat{b}_{i,t-1}-\hat{b}_{1,t-1}\right) -\left( \hat{b%
 }_{i,t}-\hat{b}_{1,t}\right) +T_{t}+R_{t-1}b_{1,t-1}-b_{1,t} \\
  &=&\left( 1-\tau _{t}\right) \theta
 _{i,t}l_{i,t}+R_{t-1}\hat{b}_{i,t-1}-\hat{b}_{i,t}+\hat{T}_{t}.
 \end{eqnarray*}%
 Suppose that $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}_{i,t}$ is not the optimal choice for consumer $i$, in the sense that there exists some
 other sequence $\left \{ \hat{c}_{i,t},\hat{l}_{i,t},\hat{b}_{i,t}\right \}_{t}$ that gives strictly higher utility.  Then the choice $%
 \left \{ \hat{c}_{i,t},\hat{l}_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \}_{t}$ is
 feasible given the tax rates  $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \} _{t}$%
 , which contradicts the assumption that $\left \{ c_{i,t},l_{i,t},b_{i,t}\right \}_{t}$ is the optimal choice for
 the consumer given taxes $\left \{ \tau _{t},T_{t}\right \}
 _{t}$. The new allocation satisfies all other constraints and
 therefore is an equilibrium.

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \ref{prop: affine eqm nec and suff}}
\label{appndx: affine eqm nec and stuff}
\smallskip

We prove a slight more general version of our result. Consider an infinite
horizon, incomplete markets economy in which an agent maximizes utility
function $U:\mathbb{R}_{+}^{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ subject to an infinite
sequence of budget constraints. We assume that $U$ is concave and
differentiable. Let $\mathbf{x}(s^t)$ be a vector of $n$ goods and let $%
\mathbf{p}(s^{t})$ be a price vector in state $s^{t}$ with $p_{i}(s^{t})$
denoting the price of good $i.$ We use a normalization $p_{1}\left(
s^{t}\right) =1$ for all $s^{t}.$
Let $b(s^{t})$ be the agent's asset holdings, and let $\mathbf{e}\left(
s^{t}\right) $ be a stochastic vector of endowments.

\textbf{Consumer maximization problem}

\begin{equation}
\max_{\mathbf{x}_{t},b_{t}}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}\Pr \left(
s^{t}\right) U(\mathbf{x}\left( s^{t}\right) )
\label{Tech appendix: consumer maximization}
\end{equation}%
subject to%
\begin{equation}
\label{Tech appendix: budget constraint}
\mathbf{p}\left( s^{t}\right) \mathbf{x}\left( s^{t}\right) +q(s^{t})b\left(
s^{t}\right) =\mathbf{p}\left( s^{t}\right) \mathbf{e}\left( s^{t}\right)
+P(s_t)b\left( s^{t-1}\right)
\end{equation}%
and $\left \{ b\left( s^{t}\right) \right \} $ is bounded and $\left \{
q(s^{t})\right \} $ is the price of the risk-free bond.

The Euler conditions are%
\begin{eqnarray}
\mathbf{U}_{x}(s^{t}) &=&U_{1}(s^{t})\mathbf{p}(s^{t})
\label{Tech appendix: Euler} \\
\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}\left( s^{t}\right) q(s^{t}) &=&\beta
\sum_{s^{t+1}>s^{t}}\Pr \left( s^{t+1}\right) U_{1}\left( s^{t+1}\right) .
\notag
\end{eqnarray}

\begin{theorem}

\smallskip Consider an allocation $\left \{ \mathbf{x}_{t},b_{t}\right \} $
that satisfies (\ref{Tech appendix: budget constraint}), (\ref{Tech
appendix: Euler}) and $\left \{ b_{t}\right \} _{t}$ is bounded. Then $%
\left
\{ \mathbf{x}_{t},b_{t}\right \} $ is a solution to (\ref{Tech
appendix: consumer maximization}).

\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
The proof follows closely Constantinides and Duffie (1996). Suppose there is
another budget feasible allocation $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{h}$ that maximizes (%
\ref{Tech appendix: consumer maximization}). Since $U$ is strictly concave,
\begin{eqnarray}
&&\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}U(\mathbf{x}_{t}+\mathbf{h}%
_{t})-\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}U(\mathbf{x}_{t})
\label{Tech appendix: gain from h} \\
&\leq &\mathbb{E}_{0}\sum_{t=0}^{\infty }\beta ^{t}\mathbf{U}_{x}(\mathbf{x}%
_{t})\mathbf{h}_{t}  \notag
\end{eqnarray}

To attain $\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{h}$, the agent must deviate by $\varphi _{t}$
from his original portfolio $b_{t}$ such that $\left\{ \varphi _{t}\right\}
_{t}$ is bounded$,$ $\varphi _{-1}=0$ and
\begin{equation*}
\mathbf{p}(s^{t})\mathbf{h}\left( s^{t}\right) =P(s_t)\varphi
(s^{t-1})-q(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t})
\end{equation*}%
Multiply by $\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}(s^{t})$ to get:%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}(s^{t})\mathbf{p}(s^{t})\mathbf{h}%
\left( s^{t}\right)  &=&\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right)
U_{1}(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t-1})-q(s^{t})\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right)
U_{1}(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t}) \\
&=&\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) U_{1}(s^{t})\varphi (s^{t-1})-\beta
^{t+1}\sum_{s^{t+1}>s^{t}}\Pr \left( s^{t+1}\right) U_{1}\left(
s^{t+1}\right) \varphi (s^{t})
\end{eqnarray*}%
where we used the second part of (\ref{Tech appendix: Euler}) in the second
equality. Sum over the first $T$ periods and use the first part of (\ref%
{Tech appendix: Euler}) to eliminate $\mathbf{U}_{x}(\mathbf{x}%
_{t})=U_{1}(s^{t})\mathbf{p}(s^{t})$%
\begin{equation*}
\sum_{t=0}^{T}\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right) \mathbf{U}_{x}(\mathbf{x}%
_{t})\mathbf{h}\left( s^{t}\right) =-\sum_{s^{T+1}>s^{T}}\beta ^{T+1}\Pr
\left( s^{T+1}\right) U_{1}\left( s^{T+1}\right) \varphi (s^{T}).
\end{equation*}%
Since $\left\{ \varphi _{t}\right\} _{t}$ is bounded there must exist $\bar{%
\varphi}$ s.t. $|\varphi _{t}|\leq \bar{\varphi}$ for all $t$. By Theorem
5.2 of Magill and Quinzii (1994), this equilibrium with debt constraints
implies a transversality condition on the right hand side of the last
equation, so by transitivity we have%
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{T\rightarrow \infty }\sum_{t=0}^{T}\beta ^{t}\Pr \left( s^{t}\right)
\mathbf{U}_{x}(\mathbf{x}_{t})\mathbf{h}\left( s^{t}\right) =0.
\end{equation*}%
Substitute this into (\ref{Tech appendix: gain from h}) to show that $%
\mathbf{h}$ does not improve utility of consumer.
\end{proof}
\newpage

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \protect\ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}}


\begin{proof}
The optimal Ramsey plan solves the following Bellman equation. Let $V(b\_)$ be the maximum ex-ante value the government can achieve with debt $b\_$.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-QLRA obj}
    V(b\_)=\max_{c(s),l(s),b(s)} \sum_{s}\pi(s)\left\{c(s)-\frac{l(s)^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}+\beta V(b(s)) \right\}
\end{equation}
subject to

   \begin{subequations}
   \label{sys- QLRA constraint}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{rep agent implementability constraint }
    c(s)+b(s)=l(s)^{1+\gamma}+\beta^{-1} P(s)b\_
    \end{equation}



\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-resoruces}
c(s)+g(s)\leq\theta l(s)
\end{equation}
Let $\bar{b}=-\underline{B}$
\begin{equation}
  \label{ndl}
\underline{b}\leq b(s)\leq \bar{b}
\end{equation}


   \end{subequations}
%Let $\mu(s)\pi(s),\phi(s)\pi(s)$ be the Lagrange multipliers on the respective constraints.

Let $\mu(s),\phi(s),\underline{\kappa}(s),\overline \kappa(s) $ be the Lagrange multipliers on the respective constraints.
\noindent {Part 1 of Theorem \textbf{\ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}}}

\begin{lemma}
There exists  a $\overline{b}$ such that $b_t\leq\overline{b}$. This is the natural debt limit for the government.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
As we drive $\mu$ to $-\infty$, the tax rate approaches a maximum limit, $\bar{\tau}=\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$. In state $s$, the government surplus,
\[
  S(s,\tau) = \theta^\frac\gamma{1+\gamma}(1-\tau)^\frac1\gamma\tau - g(s),
\]  which  is  maximized at $\tau = \frac\gamma{1+\gamma}$ when $(1-\tau)^\frac1\gamma\tau$ is also maximized. This would impose a natural borrowing limit for the government.

\end{proof}

From now we assume that $\overline{b}$ represents the natural borrowing limit. We begin with some useful lemmas

let $L\equiv l^{1+\gamma }$, to make this problem convex,

Substitute for $c\left( s\right) $%
\[
V\left( b\_\right) =\max_{L(s),b(s)}\sum_{s\in S}\pi \left(
s\right) \left[ \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L\left( s\right) +\frac{1}{\beta }%
P\left( s\right) b\_-b\left( s\right) +\beta V\left( b\left( s\right)
\right) \right]
\]%
s.t.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b-b\left( s\right) +g\left( s\right) &\leq
&\theta L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\left( s\right) -L\left( s\right) \\
b\left( s\right) &\leq &\bar{b} \\
L\left( s\right) &\geq &0.
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{lemma}
\smallskip $V\left( b\right) $ is stictly concave, continuous,
differentiable and $V\left( b\right) <\beta ^{-1}$ for all $%
b<\bar{b}.$ The feasibility constraint binds for all $b\in (-\infty ,\bar{b}%
],\ s\in S$ and $\left( L^{\ast }\left( s\right) \right) ^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\geq
\frac{1}{1+\gamma} .\footnote{
This last condition simply means that we do not tax to the right of the peak
of the Laffer curve. The revenue maximizing tax is $1-\bar{\tau}=\frac{1}{%
1+\gamma }.$ At the same time $1-\tau =l^{\gamma}$ so if taxes are always
to the left of the peak, $\frac{1}{1+\gamma }\leq l^{\gamma }=\left(
L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\right) ^{\gamma}=L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }$.}$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\smallskip \textit{Concavity}

$V\left( b\right) $ is concave because we maximize linear objective
function over convex set.

\textit{Binding feasibility}

Suppose that feasibility does not bind for some $b,s.$ Then the optimal $%
L\left( s\right) $ solve $\max_{L\left( s\right) \geq 0}\pi \left( s\right)
\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma }L\left( s\right) $ which sets $L\left( s\right)
=\infty .$ This violates feasility for any finite $b,b\left( s\right) .$

\textit{Bounds on }$L$

Let $\phi\left( s\right) >0$ be a Lagrange multiplier on the
feasibility. \ The FOC for $L\left( s\right) $ is
\[
\frac{1}{1+\gamma }+\phi(s) \left( \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L(s)^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma}
-}-\theta \right) =0.
\]%
This gives%
\[
\frac{1}{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} -1}-\theta =-\frac{1}{\lambda }\frac{\gamma}{%
1+\gamma }<0
\]%
or%
\[
L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\geq \frac{\theta }{1+\gamma }.
\]

\textit{Continuity}

For any $L$ that satisfy $L^{1-\frac{}{1+\gamma} }\geq \frac{\theta }{1+\gamma} ,$ define function $%
\Psi $ that satisfies $\Psi \left( L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }-\theta L\right) =L.$ Since $%
L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }-L$ is strictly decreasing in $L$ for $L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\geq
\frac{1}{1+\gamma} $, this function is well defined. Note that $\Psi \left(
{}\right) \underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} -1}-\theta \right) }%
_{<0}=1$ (so that $\Psi >0$, i.e. $\Psi $ is strictly decreasing)
and $\Psi ^{\prime \prime }\underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma}
-1}-1\right) ^{2}}_{>0}+\underbrace{\Psi }_{<0}\underbrace{\frac{1%
}{1+\gamma }\frac{\gamma }{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} -2}}_{<0}=0$ (so that $\Psi
^{\prime \prime }\geq 0$, $\Psi ^{\prime \prime }>0,$ i.e. $\Psi $ is
strictly concave on the interior). $\Psi $ is also continuous. When $%
L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }=\frac{1}{1+\gamma} ,$ $L=(1+\gamma) ^{-\frac{(1+\gamma)} {\left( \gamma \right)} }.$
Let $D\equiv (1+\gamma) ^{\frac{-1}{ \gamma }-(1+\gamma) ^{-\frac{1+\gamma }{\left(\gamma\right)} }}.$ Then the objective is
\[
V\left( b\_\right) =\max_{b\left( s\right) }\sum_{s\in S}\pi \left(
s\right) \left[ \Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b-b\left(
s\right) +g\left( s\right) \right) +\frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right)
b\_-b\left( s\right) +\beta V\left( b\left( s\right) \right) \right]
\]%
s.t.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
b\left( s\right) &\leq &\bar{b} \\
\frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b\_-b\left( s\right) +g\left( s\right) &\leq
&D.
\end{eqnarray*}

This function is continuous so $V$ is also continuous.

\textit{Differentiability}

Continuity and convexity implies differentiability everywhere, including the
boundaries.

\textit{Strict concavity}

$\Psi $ is strictly concave, so on the interior $V$ is strictly
concave.

\end{proof}

\smallskip Next we characterize policy functions

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem increasing b}
$b\left( s,b\_\right) $ is an increasing function of $b$ for all $s$ for all $%
s,b\_ $ where $b\left( s\right) $ is interior.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Take the FOCs for $b\left( s\right) $ from the condition in the previous
problem. If $b\left( s\right) $ is interior%
\[
\Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b\_-b\left( s\right)
+g\left( s\right) \right) =\beta V\left( b\left( s\right)
\right) .
\]

Suppose $b_{1}<b_{2}$ but $b_{2}\left( s\right) <b_{1}\left( s\right) .$
Then from stict concavity%
\begin{eqnarray*}
V\left( b_{2}\left( s\right) \right) &<&V^{\prime
}\left( b_{1}\left( s\right) \right) \\
\Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b_{2}-b_{2}\left(
s\right) +g\left( s\right) \right) &>&\Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }%
P\left( s\right) b_{1}-b_{1}\left( s\right) +g\left( s\right) \right) .
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
There exists an invariant distribution of the stochastic process $b_{t+1}=b(s_{t+1},b_t)$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The state spaces for $b_t$ and $s_t$ are compact. Further the transition function on $s_{t+1}|s_{t}$ is trivially increasing under i.i.d shocks. We can apply standard arguments as in \cite{Prescott1992}(see corollary 3) to argue that there exists invariant distribution of assets.
\end{proof}

Now we characterize the support of this distribution using further properties of the policy rules for $b(s|b\_)$


\begin{lemma}
\label{prop: b(s) relative to b}For any $b\_\in (\underline{b} ,\bar{b}),$ there are $s,s^{\prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left( s\right) \geq b\_\geq b\left( s^{\prime \prime }\right) .$ Moreover, if there are any states $s^{\prime \prime },s^{\prime \prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left( s^{\prime \prime
}\right) \neq b\left( s^{\prime \prime \prime }\right) ,$ those inequalities
are strict.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
The FOCs together with the envelope theorem imply that $\mathbb{E}P(s)V'(b(s))=V'(b\_)+\kappa(s)$
We can rewrite this as $\mathbb{\tilde{E}}V'(b(s))=b+\kappa(s)$ with $\tilde{\pi}(s)=P(s)\pi(s)$

Now if there is at least one $b\left( s\right) $ s.t. $b\left(
s\right) >b\_,$ by strict concavity of $V$ there must be some $%
s^{\prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left( s^{\prime \prime }\right) <b.$

If there is at least one $b\left( s\right) $ s.t. $b\left(
s\right) <b\_,$ the inequality above is strictly only if $b\left(
s^{\prime \prime \prime }\right) =\bar{b}$ for some $s^{\prime \prime \prime
}.$ But $V\left( \bar{b}\right) <V\left(
b\right) $ so there must be some $s^{\prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left(
s^{\prime \prime }\right) >b.$ Equality is possible only if $b\_=b\left(
s\right) $ for all $s.$
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}  Let $\mu(b,s)$ be the optimal policy function for the Lagrange multiplier $\mu(s)$.  If $P(s') > P(s'')$ then there exists a $b^*_{s',s''}$ such that for all $b < (>) \; b_{1,s',s''}$ we have $\mu(b,s') > (<) \;\mu(b,s'')$.  If $\underline b < b^*_{s',s''} < \overline b$ then $\mu(b^*_{s',s''},s') = \mu(b^*_{s',s''},s'')$.
\label{lem.order}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\mu(b,s')\leq \mu(b,s'')$.  Subtracting the implementability for $s''$ from the implementability constraint for $s'$ we have
\begin{align*}
	\frac{P(s')-P(s'')}{\beta}b &= S_{s'}(\mu(b,s'))-S_{s''}(\mu(b,s'')) + b'(b,s')-b'(b,s'')\\
						&\geq S_{s'}(\mu(b,s')) -S_{s''}(\mu(b,s')) + b'(b,s')-b'(b,s'')\\
						&\geq  S_{s'}(\mu(b,s')) -S_{s''}(\mu(b,s')) = g(s'')-g(s')
\end{align*}  We get the first inequality from noting that $S_s(\mu')\geq S_s(\mu'')$ if $\mu' \leq \mu''$.  We obtain the second inequality by noting that $\mu(b,s')\leq \mu(b,s'')$ implies $b'(b,s')\geq b'(b,s'')$ (which comes directly from the concavity of $V$).
Thus, $\mu(b,s')\leq \mu(b,s'')$ implies that
\begin{equation}
\label{pair-wise ss}
b \geq \frac{\beta(g(s'')-g(s'))}{P(s')-P(s'')} = b^*_{s',s''}
\end{equation}

The converse of this statement is that if $b<b^*_{s',s''}$ then $\mu(b,s') > \mu(b,s'')$.  The reverse statement that $\mu(b,s') \geq \mu(b,s'')$ implies $b \leq b^*_{s,s'}$ follows by symmetry.   Again, the converse implies that if $b > b^*_{s',s''}$ then $\mu(b,s') < \mu(b,s'')$.    Finally, if $\underline b < b^*_{s',s''} <\overline b$ then continuity of the policy functions implies that there must exist a root of $\mu(b,s')-\mu(b,s'')$ and that root can only be at $b^*_{s',s''}$.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{lem: existence and uniqueness of ss}
$P \in \mathcal{P}^*$ is necessary and sufficient for existence of $b^*$ such that $b(s,b^*)=b^*$ for all $s$s
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The necessary part follows from taking differences of the \eqref{rep agent implementability constraint } for $s'$,$s''$. We have
\[[P(s)-P(s'')]\frac{b^*}{\beta}=g(s)-g(s'')\]
Thus $P\in\mathcal{P}^*$. The sufficient part follows from the Lemma \ref{lem.order}. If $P \not \in \mathcal{P}^*$, equation \eqref{pair-wise ss} that defines $b^*_{s',s''}$ will not be same across all pairs. Thus $b^*$ that satisfies $b(s;b^*)$ independent of $s$ will not exist.
\end{proof}


Lemma  \ref{lem: existence and uniqueness of ss}  implies that under the hypothesis of part 1 of the Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} there cannot exist an interior absorbing point for the dynamics of debt. This allows us to construct a sequences $\{b_t\}_t $ such that $b_t<b_{t+1}$ with the property that $\lim_tb_t=\underline{b}$.
Thus, for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a finite history of shocks that can take us arbitrarily close to $\underline{b}$. Since the shocks are i.i.d this finite sequence will repeat i.o. With a symmetric argument we can show that $b_t$ will come arbitrarily close to its upper limit i.o too





{Part 2 of Theorem \textbf{\ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}}}


In this first section we will show that there exists $b_1$, and if $P(s)$ is sufficiently volatile a $b_2$, such that if $b_t\leq b_1$ then
\[
	\mu_t \geq \EE_t \mu_{t+1}
\] and if $b_t \geq b_2$ then
\[
	\mu_t \leq \EE_t \mu_{t+1}.
\]  Recall that $b$ is decreasing in $\mu$, so this implies that if $b_t$ is low (large) enough then there will exist a drift away from the lower (upper) limit of government debt.

With Lemma \ref{lem.order} we can order the policy functions $\mu(b,\cdot)$ for particular regions of the state space.  Take $b_1$ to be
\[
	b_1 = \min\left\{b^*_{s',s''}\right\}
\] and WLOG choose $\underline b < b_1$.  For all $b < b_1$ we have shown that $P(s) > P(s')$ implies that $\mu(b,s) > \mu(b,s')$.  The FOC for the problem imply,

\begin{equation}\label{eq.mart}
	\mu\_ = \EE P(s)\mu(s)+\underline{\kappa}(s)
\end{equation}  The inequality in the resource constraint implies that $\phi(s)\geq 0$ implying that $\mu(s) \leq 1$.  With some minor algebra algebra we obtain

By decomposing $\EE \mu(s)P(s)$ in equation \eqref{eq.mart}, we obtain (using $\EE P(s) = 1$)
\begin{equation}
	\mu\_ = \EE\mu(s) +\cov (\mu(s),P(s)) + \underline \kappa(s)
\end{equation}Our analysis has just shown that for $b\_ < b_1$ we have $\cov_t (\mu(s),P(s))  >0$ so
\[
	\mu\_> \EE\mu(s).
\]  If $p$ is sufficiently volatile:
\[
	P(s') - P(s'') > \frac{\beta(g(s'')-g(s'))}{\overline b}
\] then
\[
	b_2 = \max\left\{b^*_{s',s''}\right\} <\overline b
\] and through a similar argument  we can conclude that $\cov(\mu(s),P(s)) < 0$
\[
	\mu\_ < \EE \mu (s)
\] for $b\_ > b_2$ (note $b\_ >\underline b$ implies $\underline \kappa(s) =0$) which gives us a drift away from the upper-bound.


{Part 3 of Theorem \textbf{\ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}}}


When $P\in\mathcal{P}^*$, Lemma \ref{lem: existence and uniqueness of ss} implies existence of $b^*$ as the steady state debt level.
\begin{lemma}
\label{sub super martingale}
There exists $\mu^*$ such that $\mu_t$  is a sub-martingale bounded above in the region $(-\infty,\mu^*)$ and super-martingale bounded below in the region $(\mu^*,\frac{1}{1+\gamma})$


\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mu^*$ be the associated multiplier, i.e $V_b(b^*)=\mu^*$.  Using the results of the previous section, we have that $b_1 = b_2 = b^*$, implying that $\mu_t < (>) \EE_t\mu_{t+1}$ for $b_t  < (>) b^*$.
\end{proof}

Lastly we show that $\lim_t \mu_t=\mu^*$. Suppose $b_{t}<b^*$, we know that $\mu_t>\mu^*$. The previous lemma implies that in this region, $\mu_t$ is a super martingale. The lemma $\ref{lem increasing b}$ shows that $b(s,b\_)$ is continuous and increasing. This translates into $\mu(\mu(b\_),s)$ to be continuous and increasing as well.
 Thus
 \[\mu_{t}>\mu^* \implies \mu(\mu_{t},s_{t+1})>\mu(\mu^*,s_{t+1}) \]
or
 \[\mu_{t+1}>\mu^*\]
Thus $\mu*$  provides a lower bound to this super martingale. Using standard martingale convergence theorem converges. The uniqueness of steady state implies that it can only converge to $\mu^*$. For $\mu<\mu^*$, the argument is symmetric.


\end{proof}

\newpage

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \protect\ref{thm: rep agent linear policies}}
\label{appndx: ergodic distribution linearization}
Working with the first order conditions of problem \ref{eq-QLRA obj}, we obtain
\[
	l(s)^\gamma = \frac{\mu(s)-1}{(1+\gamma)\mu(s) - 1} = 1-\tau(\mu(s)),
\]
implying the relationship between tax rate $\tau$ and multiplier $\mu$ given by

\begin{equation}\label{eq.tau}
	\tau(\mu) = \frac{\gamma\mu}{(1+\gamma)\mu-1}
\end{equation}

At the interior, the rest of the first order conditions  and the implementability constraints are summarized below
\begin{align*}
	\frac{b\_ P(s)}{\beta }= S(\mu(s),s) + b(s)\\
	\mu(b\_) = \EE P(s) \mu(s)\\
\end{align*}

where $S(\mu,s)$ is the government surplus in state $s$ given by
\[
	S(\mu,s) = (1-\tau(\mu))^\frac1\gamma \tau(\mu)-g(s) = I(\mu) - g(s)
\]


The proof of the theorem will have four steps:

\textbf{Step 1:} Obtaining a recursive representation of the optimal allocation in the incomplete markets economy with payoffs $P(s)$ with state variable $\mu\_$


Given a pair $\{P(s),g(s)\}$, since $V'(b)$ is one-to-one, so we can re-characterize these equations as searching for a function $b(\mu)$ and $\mu(s|\mu\_)$such that the following two equations can be solved for all $\mu\_$.
\begin{align}\label{eq.lin_imp}
	\frac{b(\mu\_)P(s)}{\beta } = I(\mu(s)) - g(s) +b(\mu(s))\\
	\mu\_ = \EE\mu(s)P(s)\label{eq.lin_mart}
\end{align}



\textbf{Step 2:} Describe how the policy rules are approximated

Usually perturbation approaches  to solve equilibrium conditions as above look for the solutions to $\{\mu(s|\mu\_)\}$ and $b(\mu\_)$ around deterministic steady state of the model. Thus for any $b^{ss}$, there exists a $\mu^{ss}$ that will solve

\[	\frac{b^{SS}}{\beta } = I(\mu^{SS}) - \bar{g} +b^{SS}\\
\]


For example if we set the perturbation parameter $q$ to scale the shocks, $g(s)=\mathbb{E}g(s)+q\Delta_g(s)$ and $P(s)=1+q\Delta_{P}(s)$, the first order expansion of $\mu(s|\mu\_)$ will imply that it is a martingale. Such approximations are not informative about the ergodic distribution. \footnote{One can do higher order approximations, but part 3 of theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} hints that for economies with payoffs close to $\mathcal{P}^*$, the stochastic steady state in general is far away from $\mu^{SS}$.}



In contrast we will approximate the functions $\mu(s|\mu\_)$ around
around economy with payoffs in $\bar{P}\in \mathcal{P}^*$.

In contrast we a) explicitly recognize that policy rules depend on payoffs: $\mu(s|\mu\_,\{P(s)\}_s)$ and $b(\mu\_,\{P(s)\}_s)$ and then take take the first order expansion with respect to both $\mu\_$ and $\{P(s)\}$ around the vector $(\bar{\mu},\{\bar{P}(s)\}_s)$ where $\bar{P}(s) \in \mathcal{P}^*$: these payoffs support  an allocation such that limiting distribution of debt is degenerate around the some value $\bar{b}$; and  $\overline {\mu}$ is the corresponding limiting value of multiplier. The next two expression make the link between $\bar{\mu}$ and $\bar{b}$ explicit.
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq.ss.}
\begin{equation}
\overline b = \frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left( I(\overline\mu) - \overline g\right)
\end{equation}
where $\overline g = \EE g$ and $\overline p$ as
\begin{equation}
	\overline P(s) = 1- \frac\beta{\overline b}(g(s) - \overline g)
\end{equation}
\end{subequations}

As noted before $b(\overline\mu;\overline p) = \overline b$ solves the the system of equations (\ref{eq.lin_imp}-\ref{eq.lin_mart}) for $\mu'(s) = \overline \mu$ when the payoffs are $\overline{P}(s)$

We next obtain the expressions that characterize the linear approximation of $\mu(s|\mu\_,\{P(s)\})$ and $\b(\mu\_,\{P(s)\})$ around some arbitrary point $(\bar{\mu},\{\bar{P}(s)\}_s)$ where $\bar{P}(s) \in \mathcal{P}^*$. We will use these expressions to compute the mean and variance of the ergodic distribution associated with the approximated policy rules. Finally as a last step we propose a particular choice of the point of approximation.

The derivatives $\frac{\delta \mu(s|\mu\_,\{P(s)\}}{\delta \mu\_}$,$\frac{\delta \mu(s|\mu\_,\{P(s)\}}{\delta P(s)}$ and similarly for  $b(\mu\_,\{P(s)\}$ are obtained below:


Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_imp} with respect to $\mu$ around $(\overline \mu,\overline P)$ we obtain
\[
	\frac{\overline{P}(s)}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu\_} = \left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu\_}\right]\frac{\partial \mu(s)}{\partial \mu\_}.
\]Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_mart} with respect to $\mu\_$ we obtain
\[
	1 = \sum_{s} \pi(s) \overline P(s) \frac{\partial \mu'(s)}{\partial \mu\_}
\]combining these two equations we see that
\[
	\frac1\beta\left(\sum_s\pi(s)\overline P(s)^2\right)\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu\_} = I'(\mubar) + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu\_}
\]Noting that $\EE\overline P^2(s) = 1 + \frac{\beta^2}{\bbar^2}\sigma^2_g$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu\_} = \frac{I'(\mubar)}{\frac{\beta}{\bbar^2}\sigma_g^2 +\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}} < 0
\end{equation}as $I'(\mubar) < 0$.  We then have directly that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \mu'(s)}{\partial \mu} = \frac{\overline P(s)}{\frac{\beta^2}{\overline b^2}\sigma^2_g +1} = \frac{\overline P(s)}{\EE\overline P(s)^2}
\end{equation}  We can perform the same procedure for $P(s)$.  Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_imp} with respect to $P(s)$ we around $(\mubar,\pbar)$ we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq.dimp_dps}
\frac{\pbar(s')}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial P(s)} + 1_{s,s'}\frac{\bbar}{\beta} - \frac{\pi(s)\bbar\pbar(s')}{\beta} = \left[I'(\mubar) + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu}\right]\frac{\partial \mu(s')}{\partial P(s)}
\end{equation} Here $1_{s,s'}$ is $1$ if $s = s'$ and zero otherwise.  Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_mart} with respect to $P(s)$ we obtain
\[
	0 = \pi(s)\overline \mu - \pi(s)\overline \mu + \sum_{s'} \pi(s) \pbar(s')\frac{\partial \mu(s')}{\partial P(s)} =  \sum_{s'} \pi(s')\pbar(s')\frac{\partial \mu(s')}{\partial P(s)}
\]  Again we can combine these two equations to give us
\[
	\frac{\EE\pbar(s)^2}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial P(s)} + \frac{\pi(s)\bbar}{\beta}(\pbar(s)-\EE\pbar(s)^2) = 0
\] or
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial b}{\partial P(s)} = \pi(s)\bbar \frac{\EE\pbar^2-\pbar(s)}{\EE\pbar^2}
\end{equation}Going back to equation \eqref{eq.dimp_dps} we have
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \mu(s')}{\partial P(s)} = \frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I '(\mubar) + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu}\right]}\left(1_{s,s'}-\frac{\pi(s)\pbar(s)\pbar(s')}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)
\end{equation}


\textbf{Step 3:} Getting expressions for the mean and variance of the ergodic distribution around some arbitrary point of approximation

For an arbitrary $\left (\overline \mu,\{\overline {P}(s )\}_{s}\right)$, using the derivatives that we computed, we can characterize the dynamics of $\hat{\mu}\equiv\mu_t-\mubar$ using our approximated policies.


\[
	\hat \mu_{t+1} = B(s_{t+1}) \hat\mu_t + C(s_{t+1}),
\]  where $B(s)$ and $C(s)$ are respective derivatives. Note that both are random variables and let us denote their means $\barB$ and $\barC$, and variances $\sigma_B^2$ and $\sigma_C^2$ .  Suppose that $\hat\mu$ is distributed according to the ergodic distribution of this linear system with mean $\EE\hat\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2_\mu$.  Since
\[
	B\hat\mu +C,
\]has the same distribution we can compute the mean of this distribution as
\[
\begin{split}
	\EE\hat\mu &= \EE\left[ B\hat\mu+C\right]\\
			  &= \EE\left[\EE_{\hat\mu}\left[B\hat\mu+C\right]\right]\\
			  &= \EE\left[\barB\hat\mu +\barC\right]\\
			  &=\barB\EE\hat\mu+\barC
\end{split}
\]solving for $\EE\hat\mu$ we get
\begin{equation}
	\EE\hat\mu = \frac{\barC}{1-\barB}
\end{equation}For the variance $\sigma^2_{\hat\mu}$ we know that
\[
	\sigma^2_{\hat\mu} = \var(B\hat\mu+C) = \var(B\hat\mu) + \sigma_C^2 + 2\cov(B\hat\mu,C)
\]Computing the variance of $B\hat \mu$ we have
\[
\begin{split}
	\var(B\hat\mu) &=\EE\left[(B\hat\mu - \barB\EE\hat\mu)^2\right]\\
			       &=\EE\left[(B\hat\mu-\barB\hat\mu +\barB\hat\mu -\barB\EE\hat\mu)^2\right]\\
			      &=\EE\left[\EE_{\hat\mu}\left[(B-\barB)^2\hat\mu^2 +2(B-\barB)(\hat\mu-\EE\hat\mu)\barB\EE\hat\mu + (\hat\mu-\EE\hat\mu)^2\bar B^2\right]\right]\\
			&=\EE\left[\sigma_B^2\hat\mu^2 +(\hat\mu-\EE\hat\mu)^2\barB\right]\\
			& = \sigma_B^2(\sigma_{\hat\mu}^2+(\EE\hat\mu)^2) + \sigma_{\hat\mu}^2\barB^2
\end{split}
\]while for the covariance of $B\hat\mu$ and $C$
\[
	\cov(B\hat\mu,C) = \sigma_{BC}\EE\hat\mu
\]Putting this all together we have
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\hat\mu}^2 = \frac{\sigma_B^2(\EE\hat\mu)^2 + \sigma_{BC}\EE\hat\mu + \sigma_C^2}{1-\barB^2-\sigma_B^2}
\end{equation}


\textbf{Step 4:} Choice of the point of approximation

To get the expressions in Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem}, we finally choose a particular $\overline{P}=P^*(s) \in \mathcal{P}^*$. This will be the closest complete market economy to our the given $P(s)$ in $L^2$ sense. Formally,

\[
\min_{\tilde{P}\in \mathcal{P}^*} \sum_{s}\pi(s)( P(s)-\tilde{P}(s))^2.
\]
Since all payoffs in $\mathcal{P}^*$ are associated with some $b^*$ and $\mu^*$ via equations \eqref{eq.ss.},  we can re write the above problem as choosing $\mubar$ so as to minimize the variance of the difference between $ P(s)$ and the set of steady state payoffs.  Let $P^*$ be the solution to this minimization problem. The first order condition for this linearization gives us
\[
	2\sum_{s'}\pi( P(s')-P^*(s',\mu^*)) \frac{\delta P^*(s,\mu^*)}{\delta \mu^*} = 0
\]as noted before
\[
	P^*(s) =  1 -\frac{\beta}{b^*(\mu^*)}\left(g(s) - \EE g\right)
\]thus
\[
\frac{\delta P^*}{\delta \mu^*}\propto P^*-1
\]Thus we can see the the optimal choice of $\mubar$ is equivalent to choosing $\mubar$ such that
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		0 &= \sum_{s'}\pi(s')( P(s') - P^*(s',\mu^*))(P^*(s',\mu^*)-1)\\
		&= -\sum_{s'}\pi(s')( P(s')-P^*(s',\mu^*)) + \sum_{s'}\pi(s')( P(s')-P^*(s',\mu^*))P^*(s',\mu^*)\\
		&= \sum_{s'}\pi(s')( P(s')-P^*(s',\mu^*))P^*(s',\mu^*)\\
		&=\EE\left[( P-P^*)P^*\right]
	\end{split}
\end{equation}  At these values of $\pbar=P^*$ and $\mubar=\mu^*$ we have that $C$ for our linearized system is

\[
	C(s') = \sum_s\left\{\frac{{b^{*}}}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(1_{s,s'}-\frac{\pi(s) P^*(s)P^*(s')}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)(P(s)-P^*(s)) \right\}
\]Taking expectations we have that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\barC &= \sum_s\left\{\frac{{b^{*}}}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(\pi(s) - \frac{\pi(s)P^*(s)}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)( P(s)-P^*(s))\right\}\\
	&=\frac{{b^{*}}}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(\EE( P-\pbar) -\frac{\EE\left[( P-\pbar)\pbar\right]}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)\\
	&= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}  Thus the linearized system will have the same mean for $\mu$, $\mubar$, as the closest approximating steady state payoff structure.

We can also compute the variance of the ergodic distribution for $\mu$.  Note
\[
\begin{split}
	C(s') &= \sum_s\left\{\frac{{b^{*}}}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(1_{s,s'}-\frac{\pi(s) P^*(s)P^*(s')}{\EE{P^*}^2}\right)(P(s)-P^*(s)) \right\}\\
		 &=\frac{{b^{*}}}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left( P(s')-P^*(s') -P^*(s')\frac{\sum_s\pi(s)P^*(s)( p_s-P^*(s))}{\EE{P^*}^2}\right)\\
		&= \frac{{b^{*}}}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}( P(s')-P^*(s))
\end{split}
\]  As noted before
\[
	\sigma_{\mu}^2 = \frac{{b^{*}}^ 2}{\beta^2\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]^2\left(1-\barB^2-\sigma_B^2\right)}\| P-{P^*}\|^2
\]  The variance of government debt in the linearized system is
\[
	\sigma_b^2 = \frac{{b^{*}}^2\left(\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right)^2}{\beta^2\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]^2\left(1-\barB^2-\sigma_B^2\right)}\| P-{P^*}\|^2
\]  This can be simplified using the following expressions:
\[
	I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu} = \frac{\EE{P^*}^2}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu},
\]
\[
	\barB = \frac{1}{\EE{P^*}^2}
\]and
\[
	\sigma_B^2 = \frac{\var({P^*})}{(\EE{P^*}^2)^2}
\] to
\begin{equation}
	\sigma^2_b = \frac{{b^{*}}^2}{\EE{P^*}^2\var({P^*})}\|P-{P^*}\|^2
\end{equation}Noting that $\EE{P^*}^2 = 1 +\var({P^*}) > 1$, we have immediately that up to first order the relative spread of debt is bounded by
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma_b}{{b^{*}}} \leq \sqrt\frac{\|P-{P^*}\|^2}{\var({P^*})}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \protect\ref{thm heterogeneous agents}}
\label{apndx: proof heterogeneous agent}
\begin{proof}
Using Theorem \ref{theorem: main} let $\tilde{b}=b_1-b_2$. Under the normalization that $b_2=0$, the variable $\tilde{b}$ represents public debt government or the assets of the productive agent. The  optimal plan solves the following Bellman equation,

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq-2 agent QL obj}
   	V(\tilde{b}\_)=\max_{c_1(s),c_2(s),b'(s)} \sum_{s}\pi(s)\left\{\omega\left[c_1(s)-\frac{l^{1+\gamma}_1(s)}{1+\gamma}\right]+(1-\omega)c_2(s)+\beta V(\tilde{b}(s)) \right\}
\end{equation}
subject to

   \begin{subequations}
   \label{sys-2 agent QL constraint}
   	\begin{equation}
   	\label{eq-implementability constraint}
   	c_1(s)-c_2(s)+\tilde{b}(s)=l(s)^{1+\gamma}+\beta^{-1} P(s)\tilde{b}\_
   	\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
	\label{eq-resoruces}
   	n c_1(s)+(1-n)c_2(s)+g(s)\leq\theta_2 l(s)n
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
	\label{eq-non negativity of consumption}
   	c_2(s)\geq0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq-debt limits}
   	\overline{b}\geq\tilde{b}(s)\geq \underline{b}
\end{equation}
   \end{subequations}

Let $\mu(s),\phi(s),\lambda(s),\underline{\kappa}(s),\overline \kappa(s) $ be the Lagrange multipliers on the respective constraints. The FOC are summarized below

\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.het.agent.foc.c1}
\omega-\mu(s) =n \phi(s)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.het.agent.foc.c2}
1-\omega+\mu(s)-\phi(s)(1-n)+\lambda(s)=0
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
\label{eq.het.agent.foc.l}
-\omega l^\gamma(s)+\mu(s)(1+\gamma)l^{\gamma}(s)+n\phi(s)\theta=0
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.het.agent.foc.tilde_b}
\beta V'(\tilde{b}(s))-\mu(s)-\overline \kappa(s)+\underline \kappa(s)=0
\end{equation}
and the envelope condition

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.het.agent.foc.envelope}
V'(\tilde{b}\_)=\sum_{s}\pi(s)\mu(s)\beta^{-1}P(s)
\end{equation}

\end{subequations}
\end{proof}

To show part 1 of Theorem \ref{thm heterogeneous agents}, we show that $\frac{\omega}{n}>\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}$ is sufficient for the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda(s)$ on the non-negativity constraint to bind.

\begin{lemma} The multiplier on the budget constraint $\mu(s)$ is bounded above
\[\mu(s)\leq \min \left\{\omega-n,\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}\right\}\]
Similiarly the multiplier of the resource constraint is bounded below,
\[\phi(s)\geq \max \left\{1,\frac{\omega}{n}\left[\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}\right]\right\}  \]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

Notice that the labor choice of the productive household implies $\frac{1}{1-\tau}=\frac{\theta_2}{l^{\gamma}(s)}$.

As taxes go to $-\infty$ \eqref{eq.het.agent.foc.l} implies that $\mu(s)$ approaches $\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}$ from below. Similiarly the non-negativity of $c_2(s)$ imposes a lower bound of $1$ on $\phi(s)$. This translates into an upper bound of $\omega-n$ on $\mu$.
\end{proof}




\begin{lemma}
There exists a $\bar{\omega}$ such that $\omega>\bar{\omega}$ implies $c_2(s)=0$ for all $b$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}

By the KKT conditions $c_2(s)=0$ if $\lambda(s)>0$. Now \eqref{eq.het.agent.foc.c2} implies this is true if $\mu(s)<\omega-n$.  The previous lemma bounds $\mu(s)$ by $\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}$.

We can thus define $\bar{\omega} = n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$ as the required threshold Pareto weight to ensure that the unproductive agent has zero consumption forever.

\end{proof}




Now for the rest of the parts $\omega<n\left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$, we can have positive transfers for low enough public debt. In particular, we can define a maximum level of debt $\mathcal{B}$ that is consistent with an interior solution for the unproductive agents' consumption.

Guess an interior solution $c_{2,t}>0$ or $\lambda_t=0$ for all $t$. This gives us $l_t=l^*$ defined below:

\begin{equation}
\label{eq.opt.int.labor}
l^*=\left[\frac{n\theta}{\omega-(\omega-n)(1+\gamma)}\right]^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}
\end{equation}
As long as $\omega<n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$
At the interior solution $\tilde{b}(s)=\tilde b\_$ and using the implementability  constraint and resource constraints \eqref{eq-implementability constraint} and \eqref{eq-resoruces} respectively, we can obtain the expression for $c_{2}(s)$

\[c_{2}(s)=n \theta l^{*}-n {l^*}^{1+\gamma}-\tilde{b}\_(1-P(s)\beta^{-1})-g(s)\]

Non-negativity of $c_2$ implies,


\[\tilde{b}\_\leq \frac{g(s)-n\theta l^*+n{l^*}^{1+\gamma}}{\beta^{-1}P(s)-1}\]


We can also express this as
\[\tilde{b}\_\leq \frac{g(s)-\tau^*y^* }{\beta^{-1}P(s)-1},\]


where the right hand side of the previous equation is just the present discounted value of the primary deficit of the government at the constant taxes $\tau^*$ associated with $l^*$ defined in \eqref{eq.opt.int.labor}.
As long as $\beta^{-1}P(s)-1>0$, this object is well defined, we define $\mathcal{B}=\min_{s}\left[\frac{g(s)-n\theta l^*+n{l^*}^{1+\gamma}}{\beta^{-1}P(s)-1}\right]$.  Thus for $\tilde{b}\_<\mathcal{B}$ the optimal allocation has constant taxes given by $\tau^*$ and debt $\tilde{b}\_$, while  transfers are given by

\[T(s)=n \theta l^{*}-n {l^*}^{1+\gamma}-\tilde{b}\_(1-P(s)\beta^{-1})-g(s),\]

and are strictly positive.

In the next lemma we show how $\mathcal{B}$ varies with $\omega$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem comparative statics of B with omega}
For $\omega\leq n \frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma} $, we have $\frac{\partial \mathcal{B}}{\partial \omega}>0$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The sign of the derivative of $\mathcal{B}$ with respect to $\omega$ is the same as the sign of the following derivative:
\[\frac{\partial \left[{l^*}^{1+\gamma}-\theta l^*\right]}{\partial \omega}\]
Note that \eqref{eq.opt.int.labor} implies that $l^*$  is increasing in $\omega$. Note that,

\[\frac{\partial \left[{l^*}^{1+\gamma}-\theta l^*\right]}{\partial \omega}=\frac{\partial l^*}{\partial \omega}\left [ (1+\gamma){l^*}^{\gamma}-\theta\right]\]

So the sign of the required derivative depends on $\left [ (1+\gamma){l^*}^{\gamma}-\theta\right]$. We now argue that this expression is positive over the range $\omega\leq n \frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}$.


Again from the expression for $l^*$, we see that
\[\min_{\omega \leq n\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}}{l^*}^{\gamma}=\frac{\theta}{1+\gamma}\].

Thus we can see that $\mathcal{B}$ is increasing in $\omega$

\end{proof}

For initial debt greater than $\mathcal{B}$, we distinguish cases when payoffs are perfectly aligned with $g(s)$ i.e belong to the set $\mathcal{P}^*$ and when they are not. For part 2 case b, let $P\not \in \mathcal{P}^*$.

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem.limit.in.one.step}
There exists a $\check b>\mathcal{B}$ such that there are two shocks $\underline{s}$ and $\overline{s}$ and the optimal choice of debt starting from $\tilde{b}\_\leq \check b$ satisfies the following two inequalities:
\[\tilde{b}(\underline s,\tilde{b}\_)>\mathcal{B}\]
\[\tilde{b}(\overline s,\tilde{b}\_)\leq \mathcal{B}\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
At $\mathcal{B}$, there exist some $\overline s$ such that $T(\overline{s},\mathcal{B})=\epsilon>0$. Now define $\check b$ as follows:

\[\check b =\mathcal{B}	+ \frac{\epsilon \beta }{2 P(\overline{s})}\]

Now suppose to the contrary $\tilde{b}(\overline s, \tilde{b}\_)>\mathcal{B}$ for some $\tilde{b}\_\leq \check b$. This implies that $\tau(s,\tilde b\_)>\tau^*$ and $T(\overline{s}, \tilde b\_)=0$.

The government budget constraint implies


\[\frac{P(\overline s)\tilde b\_}{\beta}+g(s)=\tilde{b}(\overline s,\tilde{b}\_)+(1-\tau(\overline s, \tilde{b})\_)l(\overline s, \tilde{b}\_).\]


As,
\[\frac{P(\overline s)\tilde{b}\_}{\beta}+g(\overline s)\leq \frac{P(\overline s)\mathcal{B}}{\beta}+g(\overline s)+\frac{\epsilon}{2}< \frac{P(\overline s)\mathcal{B}}{\beta}+g(\overline s)+\epsilon\]

This further implies,
\[\tilde b(\overline s, \tilde b\_)+(1-\tau(\overline s, \tilde b\_))l(\tau(\overline s, \tilde b\_))>	[\tilde b(\overline s, \tilde b\_)+(1-\tau^*)l^*>\mathcal{B}+(1-\tau^*)l^*>\frac{P(\overline s)\tilde{b}\_}{\beta}+g(\overline s)+T(\overline s,\tilde b\_)=\frac{P(\overline s)\tilde{b}\_}{\beta}+g(\overline s)+\epsilon.\]

Combining the previous two inequalities yields a contradiction. The other  inequality, $\tilde{b}(\underline s,\tilde{b}\_)>\mathcal{B}$ follows from the definition of $\mathcal{B}$. This is because if it was not true then $\tilde{b}(s,\tilde{b}\_)\leq \mathcal{B}$ for all shocks. This implies that the solution is interior. However the only initial conditions that have this property are less than equal to $\mathcal{B}$.


Now define $\overline \mu (\tilde b(s,\tilde{b}\_))$ as $\max_{s} \mu (s,\tilde{b}\_)$ and $\hat{s}(\tilde{b}\_)$ as the shock that achieves this maximum. Now we show that $\hat \mu(\tilde b(s,\tilde{b}\_))$ is finite for all $b\_\leq\overline{b}$. We show the claim for the natural debt limit.


Let $b^{n}(s)=(\beta ^{-1}P(s)-1)^{-1}\left[\theta^{\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}}\left(\frac{1}{1+\gamma} \right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}\right)-g(s)\right]$ be the maximum debt supported by a particular shock $s$. The natural debt limit is defined as $\overline b^{n}=\min_{s}b^{n}(s)$. Note that $\lim_{b\to \overline b^{n}}\mu(\tilde{b}\_)=\infty$

Now choose $s$ such that $b^{n}(s)>\overline b^{n}$ and consider the debt choice next period for the same shock $s$ when it comes in with debt $\overline b^{n}$.


Suppose it chooses $\tilde{b}(s,\overline {b}^{n})=\overline b^{n}$, then taxes will have to be set to $\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$ and the tax income will be $\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}l(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma})=\theta^{\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}}\left(\frac{1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma} \right)$. The budget constraint will then imply that,
\[\frac{\overline  b^{n} P(s)}{\beta}+g(s)=\theta^{\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}}\left(\frac{1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma} \right)+\overline b^{n}\]
\[\overline b^{n}=(P(s)\beta^{-1}-1)^{-1}\left(\theta^{\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}}\left(\frac{1}{1+\gamma}\right)^{\frac{1}{\gamma}}\left(\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}\right) -g(s)\right) \]

However the  right hand side is the definition of $b^{n}(s)$ and,

\[b^{n}(s)>\overline b^{n}.\]

Thus we have a contradiction and the optimal choice of debt at the natural debt limit $\tilde{b}(s,\overline {b}^{n})<\overline b^{n}$.

This inturn means that $\lim_{\tilde b\to \overline b^{n}}\overline \mu (\tilde b) <\infty$.


Now note that $\overline \mu(\tilde b\_)-\mu(\tilde b\_)$ is continuous on $[\check b, \quad \overline b^{n}]$ and is bounded below by zero, therefore attains a minimum at $\tilde b^{min}$. Let $\delta=\hat \mu(\tilde b^{min})-\mu(\tilde b^{min})>\eta>0$. If this was not true then $P(s)\in \mathcal {P}^*$ as $\mu$ will have an absorbing state.


Let $\mu(\omega,n)=\omega-n$. This is the value of $\mu$ when debt falls below $\mathcal{B}$.

Now consider any initial $\tilde b\_ \in [\mathcal{B},\overline b^{n}]$. If $\tilde{b}\_\leq \check b$, then by lemma \ref{lem.limit.in.one.step}, we know that $\mathcal{B}$ will be reached in one shock. Otherwise if $\tilde b\_>\check b$, we can construct a sequence of shocks $s_t=\hat s (\tilde b_{t-1})$ of length $N=\frac{\mu(\omega,n)-\mu(\tilde b\_)}{\delta}$. There exits $t<N$ such that $\tilde b_t<\check b$, otherwise,
\[\mu_t>\mu(\tilde b\_)+N\delta>\mu(\omega,n)\]

Thus we can reach $\mathcal{B}$ in finite steps. Since shocks are i.i.d, this is an almost sure statement. At $\mathcal{B}$, transfers are strictly positive for some shocks $T_t>0$ a.s. and taxes are given by $\tau^*$.




Now consider the payoffs $P\in \mathcal {P}^*$ such that the associated steady state debt $b^*>\mathcal{B}$. Under the guess $T_t=0$, the same algebra as in Theorem \ref{thm: rep agent general theorem} goes through and we can show that $\tilde b\_=b^*$ is a steady state for the heterogeneous agent economy. Thus the heterogeneous agent economy for a given $P\in \mathcal{P}^*$ has a continuum of steady states given by the set $[\overline b, \quad \mathcal{B}] \cup \{b^*\}$.



In the region $\tilde b\_>b^*$, as before $\mu_t$ is supermartingale bounded below by $b^*$. Since there is a unique fixed point in the region $\tilde b\_ \in [b^*, \overline b^{n}]$, $\mu_t$ converges to $\mu^*$ associated with $b^*$. Transfers are zero and taxes are given by $\tau^{**}$


\begin{equation}
\tau^{**} = \frac{\gamma\mu^*}{(1+\gamma)\mu^*-1}
\end{equation}



In the region $[\mathcal{B},\quad b^*]$ the outcomes depend on the exact sequence of shocks we can show that $\mu_t$ is a submartingale. This follows from the observation that for all $\tilde b\_> \mathcal{B}$, we have $T(s)=0$ and the outcomes from the representative agent economy allow us to order $\mu(s)$ relative $P(s)$. At $\tilde{b}\_=\mathcal{B}$, $\mu(s)=\omega-n$ and is constant. Thus in the region $[\mathcal{B},\quad B^*]$, $\mu_t$ is sub martingale and it converges. However if $\tilde b_t$ gets sufficiently close to $\check b$, then it can converge to $\mathcal{B}$ and if it gets sufficiently close to $b^*$, it can converge to $b^*$. Either of this can happen with strictly positive probability.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Proof of Theorem \protect\ref{thm long run forces}}

The Bellman equation for the optimal planners problem with log quadratic
preferences and IID shocks can be written as
\begin{equation*}
V(x,\rho) = \max_{c_1,c_2,l_1,x^{\prime },\rho^{\prime }} \sum_s \pi(s)\left[%
\alpha_1\left(\log c_1(s) -\frac{l_1(s)^2}{2}\right)+\alpha_2\log
c_2(s)+\beta V(x^{\prime }(s),\rho^{\prime }(s))\right]
\end{equation*}%
subject to the constraints
\begin{align}
1+\rho^{\prime }(s)[l_1(s)^2-1]+\beta x^{\prime }(s) - \frac{x\frac{P(s)}{%
c_2(s)}}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P(s)}{c_2(s)}]}=0  \label{eq.conStart} \\
\mathbb{E}\frac{P(s)}{c_1(s)}(\rho^{\prime }(s)-\rho) = 0 \\
\theta_1(s)l_1(s) -c_1(s)-c_2(s)-g = 0 \\
\rho^{\prime }(s) c_2(s)-c_1(s) = 0  \label{eq.conEnd}
\end{align}
where the $\pi(s)$ is the probability distribution of the aggregate state $s$. If
we let $\pi(s)\mu(s)$, $\lambda$, $\pi(s)\xi(s)$ and $\pi(s)\phi(s)$ be the
Lagrange multipliers for the constraints (\ref{eq.conStart})-(\ref{eq.conEnd}%
) respectively then we obtain the following FONC for the planners problem \footnote{Appendix \ref{apndx: numerical methods} discuses the associated second order conditions that ensure these policies are optimal}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[$c_1(s):$]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\alpha_1\pi(s)}{c_1(s)}-\frac{\lambda \pi(s)}{c_1(s)^2}(\rho^{\prime
}(s)-\rho)-\pi(s)\xi(s)-\pi(s)\phi(s) = 0  \label{eq.c1FOC}
\end{equation}

\item[$c_2(s):$]
\begin{equation}
\frac{\alpha_2 \pi(s)}{c_2(s)} + \frac{x P(s)\pi(s)}{c_2(s)^2\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}%
\left[\mu(s)-\frac{\mathbb{E}[\mu\frac{P}{c_2}]}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}%
\right]-\pi(s)\xi(s)+\pi(s)\rho^{\prime }(s)\phi(s)=0  \label{eq.c2FOC}
\end{equation}

\item[$l_1(s):$]
\begin{equation}
-\alpha_1\pi(s)l_1(s)+2\mu(s)\pi(s)\rho^{\prime
}(s)l_1(s)+\theta_1(s)\pi(s)\xi(s)=0
\end{equation}

\item[$x^{\prime }(s):$]
\begin{equation}
V_x(x^{\prime }(s),\rho^{\prime }(s)) + \mu(s) = 0
\label{eq.x'FOC}
\end{equation}

\item[$\rho^{\prime }(s):$]
\begin{equation}
 \beta V_{\rho}(x^{\prime }(s),\rho^{\prime }(s))+\frac{\lambda \pi(s)}{%
c_1(s)}+\mu(s)[l_1(s)^2-1]+\pi(s)\phi(s)c_2(s) = 0  \label{eq.FOCNend}
\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}

In addition there are two envelope conditions given by
\begin{align}
V_x(x,\rho) = -\sum_{s^{\prime }}\frac{\mu(s^{\prime })\pi(s^{\prime
})\frac{P(s)}{c_2(s^{\prime })}}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]} = -\frac{\mathbb{E}%
[\mu\frac{P}{c_2}]}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]} \\
V_{\rho}(x,\rho) = -\lambda\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_1}]  \label{eq.rho_env}
\end{align}

In the steady state, we need to solve for a collection of allocations, initial conditions and Lagrange multipliers $%
\{c_1(s),c_2(s),l_1(s),x,\rho,\mu(s),\lambda,\xi(s),\phi(s)\}$ such that
equations (\ref{eq.conStart})-(\ref{eq.rho_env}) are satisfied when $%
\rho^{\prime }(s) = \rho$ and $x^{\prime }(s) = x$. It should be clear that if we replace $\mu(s) = \mu$, equation (\ref{eq.x'FOC})  and the envelope condition with respect to $x$ is
always satisfied. Additionally under this assumption equation (\ref{eq.c2FOC}%
) simplifies significantly,since
\begin{align*}
\frac{xP(s)\pi(s)}{c_2(s)^2\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}\left[\mu(s)-\frac{\mathbb{E}%
[\mu\frac{P}{c_2}]}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}\right] = 0
\end{align*}
The first order conditions for a
steady can then be written simply as
\begin{align}
1+\rho[l_1(s)^2-1]+\beta x-\frac{x P(s)}{ c_2(s)\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]} = 0
\label{eq.imp} \\
\theta_1(s) l_1(s) - c_1(s)-c_2(s)-g=0  \label{eq.res} \\
\ \rho c_2(s)-c_1(s) = 0  \label{eq.rhoFOC} \\
\frac{\alpha_1}{c_1(s)}-\xi(s)-\phi(s) = 0  \label{eq.c1} \\
\frac{\alpha_2}{c_2(s)}-\xi(s)+\rho\phi(s) = 0  \label{eq.c2} \\
[2\mu \rho-\alpha_1]l_1(s)+\theta_1(s)\xi(s) = 0  \label{eq.l1} \\
\lambda\left(\frac{P(s)}{c_1(s)}-\beta\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{P}{c_1}\right]\right)+\mu[%
l_1(s)^2-1]+\phi(s)c_2(s) = 0  \label{eq.R}
\end{align}
We can rewrite equation (\ref{eq.c1}) as
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\alpha_1}{c_2(s)} - \rho\xi(s) -\rho\phi(s) = 0
\end{equation*}%
by substituting $c_1(s) = \rho c_2(s)$. Adding this to equation (\ref{eq.c2}%
) and normalizing $\alpha_1+\alpha_2 = 1$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
\xi(s) = \frac1{\left(1+\rho\right)c_2(s)}\label{eq.xi}
\end{equation}%
which we can use to solve for $\phi(s)$ as
\begin{equation}
\phi(s) = \frac{\alpha_1-\rho\alpha_2}{\left(\rho(1+\rho)\right)c_2(s)}
\label{eq.phi}
\end{equation}
From equation (\ref{eq.imp}) we can solve for $l_1(s)^2 -1$ as
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s)^2-1 = \frac{x}{\rho\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}\left(\frac
{P(s)}{c_2(s})-\beta\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{P}{c_2}\right]\right)-\frac1\rho
\end{equation*}%
This can be used along with equations (\ref{eq.R}) and (\ref{eq.phi}) to
obtain
\begin{equation*}
\left(\frac\lambda \rho+\frac{\mu x}{\rho\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}%
\right)\left(\frac{P(s)}{c_2(s)}-\beta\mathbb{E}\left[\frac{P}{c_2}\right]%
\right) = \frac{\mu}{\rho}+\frac{\rho\alpha_2-\alpha_1}{\rho(1+\rho)}
\end{equation*}
Note that the LHS depends on $s$ while the RHS does not, hence the solution to
this equation is
\begin{equation}
\lambda = - \frac{\mu x}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}
\end{equation}%
and
\begin{equation}
\mu = \frac{\alpha_1-\rho\alpha_2}{1+\rho}  \label{eq.mu}
\end{equation}
Combining these with equation (\ref{eq.l1}) we quickly obtain that
\begin{equation*}
\left[2\rho\frac{\alpha_1-\rho\alpha_2}{1+\rho}-\alpha_1\right]%
l_1(s)+\frac{\theta_1(s)}{\left(1+\rho\right)c_2(s)} = 0
\end{equation*}%
Then solving for $l_1(s)$ gives
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s) = \frac{\theta_1(s)}{\left(\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2\right)c_2(s)}
\end{equation*}

\begin{remark}
Note that the labor tax rate is given by $1-\frac{c_1(s)l_1(s)}{\theta(s)}$. The previous expression shows that labor taxes are constant at the steady state. This property holds generally for CES preferences separable in consumption and leisure
\end{remark}

This we can plug into the aggregate resource constraint (\ref{eq.res}) to
obtain
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s) = \left(\frac{1+\rho}{\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2}\right)\frac{1}{l_1(s)} +
\frac{g}{\theta_1(s)}
\end{equation*}%
letting $C(\rho) = \frac{1+\rho}{\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2}$ we can
then solve for $l_1(s)$ as
\begin{equation*}
l_1(s) = \frac{g\pm\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)}
\end{equation*}
The marginal utility of agent 2 is then
\begin{equation*}
\frac1{c_2(s)} = \left(\frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\right)\left(\frac{g\pm\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)%
\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)^2}\right)
\end{equation*}%
Note that in order for either of these terms to be positive we need $%
C(\rho)\geq 0$ implying that there is only one economically meaningful root.
Thus
\begin{equation}
l_1(s) = \frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\frac1{c_2(s)} = \left(\frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\right)\left(\frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)%
\theta_1(s)^2}}{2\theta_1(s)^2} \right) \label{eq.uc2}
\end{equation}
A steady state is then a value of $\rho$ such that
\begin{equation}
x(s) = \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s)^2-1]}{\frac{P(s)/c_2(\rho,s)}{\mathbb{E}%
[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta}  \label{eq.xSS}
\end{equation}%
s independent of $s$.

The following lemma, which orders consumption and labor across states, will
be useful in proving the parts of theorem \ref{prop: long run forces}.  As a notational aside we
will often use $\theta_{1,l}$ and $\theta_{1,h}$ to refer to $%
\theta_{1}(s_l) $ and $\theta_{1}(s_h)$ respectively. Where $s_l$ refers to
the low TFP state and $s_h$ refers to the high TFP state.

\begin{lemma}
Suppose that $\theta_1(s_l) < \theta_2(s_h)$ and $\rho$ such that $C(\rho) >
0$ then
\begin{equation*}
l_{1,l} = \frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_{1,l}^2}}{2\theta_{1,l}} > \frac{%
g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_{1,h}^2}}{2\theta_{1,h}} = l_{1,h}
\end{equation*}
and
\begin{equation*}
\frac1{c_{2,l}} = \frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)%
\theta_{1,l}^2}}{2\theta_{1,l}^2} > \frac{1+\rho}{C(\rho)}\frac{g+\sqrt{%
g^2+4C(\rho)\theta_{1,h}^2}}{2\theta_{1,h}^2} = \frac1{c_{2.h}}
\end{equation*}%
\label{lem.1}
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
The results should follow directly from showing that
the function
\begin{equation*}
l_1(\theta) = \frac{g+\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta}}{2\theta}
\end{equation*}%
is decreasing in $\theta$. Taking the derivative with respect to $\theta$
\begin{align*}
\frac{d l_1}{d\theta}(\theta) &=- \frac g{2\theta^2}-\frac{\sqrt{%
g+4C(\rho)\theta^2}}{2\theta^2} +\frac{4C(\rho)\theta}{2\theta\sqrt{%
g^2+4C(\rho)\theta^2}} \\
&=-\frac g{2\theta^2}-\frac{g+4C(\rho)\theta^2-4C(\rho)\theta^2}{2\theta^2%
\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta^2}} \\
&=-\frac g{2\theta^2}-\frac{g}{2\theta^2\sqrt{g^2+4C(\rho)\theta^2}}<0
\end{align*}
That $\frac1{c_{2,l}}>\frac1{c_{2,h}}$ follows directly.
\end{proof}

Now we use these lemma to prove the part 1 and part 2 of theorem \ref{thm long run forces}



\begin{proof}

\textbf {[Part 1.]} For a riskfree bond when $P(s)=1$.
In order for there to exist a $\rho$ such that equation (\ref%
{eq.xSS}) is independent of the state (and hence have a steady state) we
need the existence of root for the following function
\begin{equation*}
f (\rho) = \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]}-\frac{%
\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta }{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta}
\end{equation*}
From lemma \ref{lem.1} we can conclude that
\begin{equation}
1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1] > 1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]  \label{eq.inc_order}
\end{equation}%
and
\begin{equation}
\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta >\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta  \label{eq.int_order}
\end{equation}%
for all $\rho > 0$ such that $C(\rho)\geq 0$. To begin with we will define $%
\underline \rho$ such that $C(\rho) > 0$ for all $\rho > \underline\rho$.
Note that we will have to deal with two different cases.

\begin{description}
\item[$\protect\alpha_1(1-\protect\rho)+2\protect\rho^2\protect\alpha_2 > 0$
for all $\protect\rho\geq 0$:] In this case we know that $C(\rho)\geq 0$ for
all $\rho$ and is bounded above and thus we will let $\underline \rho =0$.

\item[$\protect\alpha_1(1-\protect\rho)+2\protect\rho^2\protect\alpha_2 = 0$
for some $\protect\rho>0$:] In this case let $\underline \rho$ be the
largest positive root of $\alpha_1(1-\rho)+2\rho^2\alpha_2$. Note that $%
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline \rho^+}C(\rho) = \infty$
\end{description}

With this we note that\footnote{In the first case $\underline {\rho}=0$ and in the second case $l_1(\rho,s_l)=l_1(\rho,s_h)$ as $\rho \to \underline{\rho}^{+}$}
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline \rho^+} \frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+%
\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]} = 1
\end{equation*}%
We can also show that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\underline \rho^+} \frac{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{%
E}[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta }{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}%
[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta} < 1
\end{equation*}
which implies that $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline \rho^+} f(\underline
\rho) > 0$.

Taking the limit as $\rho\rightarrow\infty$ we see that $C(\rho)\rightarrow
0 $, given that $\frac g{\theta(s)} <1$, we can then conclude that
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow\infty } 1+ \rho[l_1(\rho,s)^2-1] = -\infty
\end{equation*}
Thus, there exists $\overline \rho$ such that $1+\overline \rho[%
l_1(\overline \rho,s_l)^2-1] = 0$. \footnote{This can be seen from the fact $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \underline
\rho^+} 1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2 -1] > 0$ and $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \infty } 1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2 -1] > -\infty$, thus $\overline{\rho}$ exists in $(\underline{\rho},\infty)$ } From equation (\ref{eq.inc_order}), we
know that
\begin{equation*}
0 = 1+\overline \rho[l_1(\overline \rho,s_l)^2-1] > 1+\overline \rho[%
l_1(\overline \rho,s_h)^2-1]
\end{equation*}
which implies in the limit
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \overline \rho^-}\frac{1+\rho[l_1(\rho,s_h)^2-1]}{1+%
\rho[l_1(\rho,s_l)^2-1]} = -\infty
\end{equation*}
which along with
\begin{equation*}
\frac{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_h)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}-\beta }{\frac{%
1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]}-\beta} \geq -1
\end{equation*}
allows us to conclude that $\lim_{\rho\rightarrow \overline \rho^-} f(\rho)
= -\infty$. The intermediate value theorem then implies that there exists $%
\rho_{SS}$ such that $f(\rho_{SS}) = 0$ and hence that $\rho_{SS}$ is a
steady state.

Finally, as $\rho_{SS} < \overline \rho$ we know that
\begin{equation*}
1+\rho_{SS}[l_1(\rho_{SS},s_l)-1] >0
\end{equation*}%
as $\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}]} >1$ we can
conclude
\begin{equation*}
x_{SS} = \frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_1(\rho_{SS},s_l)-1]}{\frac{1/c_2(\rho,s_l)}{%
\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_2}](\rho)}-\beta} >0
\end{equation*}%
implying that the government will hold assets in the steady state (under the
normalization that agent 2 holds no assets).

\textbf {[Part 2]} As noted before, since $g/\theta (s)<1$ for all $s$ we have
\begin{equation*}
\lim_{\rho \rightarrow \infty }1+\rho \lbrack l_{1}(\rho ,s)^{2}-1]=-\infty
\end{equation*}%
Thus, there exists $\rho_{SS}$ such that
\begin{equation*}
0>1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})^{2}-1]>1\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{h})^{2}-1]
\end{equation*}%
It is then possible to choose $P (s)$ such that $\beta <\frac{P(s)/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s)}{%
\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_{2}}]}$ such that
\begin{equation}
1>\frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})^{2}-1]}{1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{h})^{2}-1]}=\frac{\frac{P(s_l)/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})%
}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_{2}}]}-\beta}{\frac{%
P(s_h)/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{h})}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_{2}}]}%
-\beta }  \label{eq.beta_cond}
\end{equation}%
Implying that for Payoff shocks $P(s)$, $\rho_{SS}$ is a
steady state level for the ratio of marginal utilities, with steady state
marginal utility weighted government debt
\begin{equation*}
x_{SS}=\frac{1+\rho_{SS}[l_{1}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})^{2}-1]}{\frac{%
P(s_l)/c_{2}(\rho_{SS},s_{l})}{\mathbb{E}[\frac{P}{c_{2}}]}%
-\beta}<0
\end{equation*}%
Thus, in the steady state, the government is holding debt, under the
normalization that the unproductive worker holds no assets. Note this imposes a restriction of $\frac{P(s_l)}{P(s_h)}$.

\[\frac{P(s_l)c_2^{-1}(\rho_{SS},s_l)-\beta \mathbb{E}Pc_2^{-1}}{P(s_h)c_2^{-1}(\rho_{SS},s_h)-\beta \mathbb{E}Pc_2^{-1}}<1\]
or

\[\frac{P(s_l)}{P(s_h)}<\frac{c_2^{-1}(\rho_{SS},s_h)}{c_2^{-1}(\rho_{SS},s_l)}<1\]

or

Thus $P(s_l)<P(s_h)$ i.e payoffs have to be sufficiently procyclical.

\end{proof}


\subsection{Linearization Algorithm}\label{apndx: numerical methods}
This section will outline our numerical methods used to solve for and linearize around the steady state in the case of a 2 state iid process for the aggregate state.
\begin{equation}
	V(\bm x,\bm \rho) = \max_{c_i(s),l_i(s),\bm x'(s),\bm\rho'(s)} \sum_s P(s)\left(\left[\sum_i\pi_i \alpha_i U(c_i(s),l_i(s))\right] + \beta(s) V(\bm x'(s),\bm \rho'(s))\right)\label{eq.obj}
\end{equation}
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
	&U_{c,i}(s)c_i(s)+U_{l,i}(s)l_i(s) - \rho_i'(s)\left[U_{c,1}(s)c_1(s)+U_{l,1}(s)l_1(s)\right]+ \beta(s)x_i'(s) = \frac{x_i U_{c,i}(s)}{\mathbb{E} U_{c,i}}\label{eq.imp_con}\\
	&\sum_s \Pr(s) U_{c,1}(s)(\rho_i(s) -\rho_i) = 0\\
	&\frac{\rho'(s)}{\theta_1(s)}U_{l,1}(s) = \frac{1}{\theta_i(s)}U_{l,i}(s)\\
	& \sum_{j=0}^I\pi_j c_j(s)  + g(s) = \sum_{j=0}^{I} \pi_j\theta_j(s)l_j(s)\\
	& U_{c,i}(s) = \rho_i'(s) U_{c,1}(s)\label{eq.rho_con}
\end{align}\end{subequations}  For $i=2,\ldots,I$.  Note that some of the constraints have been modified a little for ease of differentiation.  Associated with these constraints we have the Lagrange multipliers $\Pr(s)\mu'_i(s)$, $\lambda_i$,$\Pr(s)\phi_i(s)$,$\Pr(s)\xi(s)$, and $P(s)\zeta_i(s)$.
%\subsubsection{Steady State}

%By taking first order conditions it is possible to numerically determine the location of a stationary steady state.
The first order conditions with respect to the choice variables are as follows (note we will be using the notation $\mathbb E z$ to represent $\sum_s \Pr(s) z(s)$ for some variable $z$)
\begin{subequations}
\begin{description}
	\item[$c_1(s)$:]
	\begin{align}

In addition to these we have the two envelop conditions
\begin{subequations}
\begin{equation}
	V_{x_i}(\bm x,\bm \rho)= \frac{\sum_sP(s) \mu'_i(s) U_{c,i}(s)}{\mathbb E U_{c,i}(s)} = \frac{\mathbb E\mu_i' U_{c,i}}{\mathbb E U_{c,i}}\label{eq.env_x},
\end{equation}and
\begin{equation}
	V_{\rho_i}(\bm x,\bm \rho) = -\lambda_i \mathbb E U_{c,1}\label{eq.env_rho}.
 \end{equation}\end{subequations}

%  A steady state will then be a set of allocations and Lagrange multipliers $\{c_1(s),c_i(s),l_1(s),l_i(s),\bm x,\bm \rho,\bm \mu'(s),\bm \lambda,\bm \phi(s),\xi(s),\bm \zeta(s)\}$  that solve equations (\ref{eq.imp_con})-(\ref{eq.rho_con}), (\ref{eq.foc_c1})-(\ref{eq.foc_rho}), and (\ref{eq.env_x})-(\ref{eq.env_rho}).  It should be noted that taking $\mu_i(s) = \mu_i = V_{x_i}(\bm x,\bm \rho)$ will solve both equations (\ref{eq.foc_x}) and (\ref{eq.env_x}).  Thus a steady state will be a set of allocations and Lagrange multipliers $\{c_1(s),c_i(s),l_1(s),l_i(s),\bm x,\bm \rho,\bm \mu,\bm \lambda,\bm \phi(s),\xi(s),\bm \zeta(s)\}$ that solves the following system of equations

% \end{align}\end{subequations}  Taking $z$ to be the stacked vector $\{c_1(s),c_i(s),l_1(s),l_i(s),\bm x,\bm \rho,\bm \mu,\bm \lambda,\bm \phi(s),\xi(s),\bm \zeta(s)\}$, the equations (\ref{eq.FSS_start})-(\ref{eq.FSS_end}) then define a vector function $F_{SS}(X)$ for which the steady state must satisfy $F_{SS}(X_{SS}) = 0$.  An observant reader will have noted that the system $F_{SS}(X) = 0$ is only square when then number of aggregates states is 2.   In the case of where there are 2 aggregate states we have verified numerically ( using a non-linear equation solver ) that a steady state does exist for nearly all of the parameter space.  When the number of states is greater than two, there generically does not exist a steady state, however we find numerically that there exists an $\tilde X$ such that $F_{SS}(\tilde X) \approx 0$.  Our solutions to Bellman equation find that the economy will converge in the long run to a region a round this point.
% \subsubsection{Linearization}
In order to check local stability we linearize locally around the steady state. Furthermore we find that the policy functions have better numerical properties when the state variables are chosen to be ($\bm \mu,\bm \rho$) rather than ($\bm x,\bm \rho$), and thus, we will proceed with the linearization procedure using $(\bm \mu,\bm \rho)$ as the endogenous state vector.  The evolution of the state variable $\bm  \mu$ must follow the weighted martingale
\begin{equation}
	\mu_i - \frac{\sum_s P(s) \mu_i'(s)U_{c,i}(s)}{\sum_s P(s) U_{c,i}(s)} = 0\label{eq.mu_mart}.
\end{equation}  The optimal policy function, which we will denote as $z(\bm \mu,\bm\rho)$, must satisfy $F(z,y,g(z)) = 0$ where $F$ represents the system of equations (\ref{eq.imp_con})-(\ref{eq.foc_rho})and \eqref{eq.mu_mart}, $y$ is the state vector $(\bm x,\bm \rho)$, and $g$ is the mapping of the policies into functions of future variables, namely $\bm x'(s)$ and $V_{\bm \rho}(\bm \mu'(s),\bm \rho(s))$.  In other words
\[
	g(z) = \left(\bmat \bm x(\bm \mu'(1),\bm \rho'(1))\\ V_{\bm \rho}(\bm \mu'(1),\bm \rho'(1)\\ \bm x(\bm \mu'(2),\bm \rho'(2))\\ V_{\bm \rho}(\bm \mu'(2),\bm \rho'(2))\emat\right).
\]  Finally $z(\bm \mu,\bm \rho)$ are the stacked variables $\{c_1(s),c_i(s),l_1(s),l_i(s),\bm x,\bm \rho'(s),\bm \mu'(s),\bm \lambda,\bm \phi(s),\xi(s),\bm \zeta(s)\}$.  The optimal policy function is then a function $z(y)$ that satisfies the relationship $F(z(y),y,g(z(y))) = 0$.  Taking total derivatives around the steady state $\ov y$ and $\ov z = z(\ov y)$
\[
	D_zF(\ov z,\ov y, g(\ov z))D_yz(\ov y)+D_yF(\ov z, \ov y, g(\ov z)) + D_g F(\ov z, \ov y, g(\ov z)) D g(\ov z) D_y z(\ov z) = 0
\]  In order to linearize $z(y)$ around the steady state $\ov y$ we need to compute $D_y z(\ov y)$.   The envelope condition (\ref{eq.env_rho}) tell us that $V_{\bm \rho}$ can be computed from the optimal policies, i.e.
\[
	\left(\bmat \bm x(\bm \mu,\bm \rho)\\\ V_{\bm \rho}(\bm \mu,\bm \rho)\emat\right) = w( z(\bm \mu,\bm \rho) ) =  \left(\bmat \bm x\\ -\bm \lambda \mathbb E\left[U_{c,1}\right]\emat\right)
\]  If we let $\Phi_s$ be the matrix that maps $z(\bm \mu,\bm \rho)$ into $\left(\bmat \bm \mu'(s)\\ \bm \rho'(s)\emat\right)$ then we can write $g(\bm \mu,\rho)$ using $z$ and $w$ as follows
\[
	g(z) = \left(\bmat w(z(\Phi_1 z))\\ w(z(\Phi_2 z))\emat\right)
\]taking derivatives we quickly obtain that
\begin{align*}
	D_z g(\ov z) &= \left(\bmat D w(z(\Phi_1 \ov z)) & 0 \\ 0&  D w(z(\Phi_2 \ov z))\emat\right)\left(\bmat D_y z(\Phi_1 \ov z) & 0\\ 0& D_y z(\Phi_1\ov z)\emat\right) \underbrace{\left(\bmat \Phi_1\\ \Phi_2\emat\right)}_{\Phi}\\
	&=\left(\bmat Dw(\ov z) &0\\0& D w(\ov z)\emat\right)\left(\bmat D_y z(\ov y) &0\\0&D_y z(\ov y)\emat\right)\Phi\\
	&=\left(\bmat Dw(\ov z)D_y z(\ov y) &0\\0& D w(\ov z)D_y z(\ov y)\emat\right)\Phi
\end{align*}  We can then go back to our original matrix equation to obtain
\begin{align}
	D_zF(\ov z,\ov y, \ov w)D_yz(\ov y)+D_yF(\ov z, \ov y, \ov w) + D_w F(\ov z, \ov y, \ov w)\left(\bmat Dw(\ov z)D_y z(\ov y) &0\\0& D w(\ov z)D_y z(\ov y)\emat\right)\Phi D_y z(\ov z) = 0\label{eq.linearization},
\end{align} where $\ov w = g(\ov z) = w(\ov z)$.  This is now a non-linear matrix equation for $D_y z(\ov y)$,  where all the other terms can be computed using the steady state values $\ov z$ and $\ov y$ (note $g(\ov z)$ is known from the envelope conditions at the steady state).  Furthermore, $D_y z(\ov y)$ gives us the linearization of the policy rules since to first order
\[
	z \approx \ov z + D_y z(\ov y)(y-\ov y)
\]Our procedure for computing the linearization proceeds as follows
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Find the steady state by solving the system of equations (\ref{sys-steadystate}).  Numerically, we have found that this is very robust to the parameters of the model.
		\item  Compute $D_zF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))$, $D_zF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))$ and $D_vF(\ov z,\ov y,g(\ov z))$ by numerically differentiating $F$.  This is straightforward using auto-differentiation.
		\item  Compute $Dw(\ov z)$ using auto-differentiation.
		\item  Construct a matrix equation as follows.  Given policies $A = Dw(\ov z)D_yz(\ov y)$ (these are the linearized policies of $\bm x$ and $V_{\bm \rho}$ with respect to $(\bm \mu,\bm \rho)$), it is possible to solve for $D_yz(\ov y)$ from
		\[
			  D_y z(\ov z) =-\left(D_zF(\ov z,\ov y, \ov w)+D_w F(\ov z, \ov y, \ov w)\left(\bmat A &0\\0&A\emat\right)\Phi\right)^{-1}D_yF(\ov z,\ov y,\ov w)
		\]  We wish to find an $A$ such that
		\[
			A = Dw(\ov z)   D_y z(\ov z)
		\]
	\end{enumerate}
Given the linearized policy rules it is then possible to evaluate the local stability of the steady state.  We find that in the absence of discount factor shocks the steady state is stable generically across the parameter space.

This linearization can be used to construct the bordered hessian of the problem (\ref{eq:ss-obj}) at the steady state. We can then apply second order tests to verify that the first order necessary conditions are sufficient.
%The code for computing the Bellman equations, steady states and the linearized policies is available at https://github.com/dgevans/Golosov-Sargent.git
\subsection{Proof for Theorem \ref{thm: localstability}}
\label{apndx: stability}
 \begin{proof}

 The state at time $t$ can be written as
 	\[
 		\hat{\Psi}_t = C_tC_{t-1}\cdots C_1\hat{\Psi}_0.
 	\]where the $C_i$ are all random variables being $C(s)$ with probability $\pi(s)$. Taking expectations and applying independence we then obtain
% 	
 	\begin{align}
 	\mathbb{E}_0[\hat{\Psi}_t] &= \mathbb{E}_0[C_tC_{t-1}\cdots C_1] \hat{\Psi}_0\\
 	&=\mathbb{E}[C_t] \mathbb{E}[C_{t-1}]\cdot\mathbb{E}[C_1] \hat{\Psi}_0\\
 	&=\overline C^t \hat{\Psi}_0
 	\end{align}
 	where $\overline C = \mathbb{E}C(s)$.  If eigenvalues of $\overline C$ are positive and strictly less than 1, at least, in expectation the linearized system converges that is
 	\begin{equation}
 		 \bar{\hat{\Psi}}_{t|0} \equiv \mathbb{E}_0[\hat{\Psi}_t] = \overline {C}^t \hat{\Psi}_0\to\bm 0.
 	\end{equation}It should be noted that the conditional expectation actually captures a significant portion of the linearized dynamics.
	The remaining question is does the distribution converge to $\bm 0$.  This can be done by analyzing the variance.  Let
 	\[
 		\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0} = \mathbb{E}_0\left[(\hat{\Psi}_t-\bar {\hat{\Psi}}_t)(\hat{\Psi}_{t|0}-\bar {\hat{\Psi}}_{t|0})'\right]
 	\]
 	
 	or
 	\begin{equation}
 	 \Sigma_{\Psi,t|0}=\mathbb{E}_{0}\hat{\Psi}_t\hat{\Psi}_t'- \bar{\hat{\Psi}}_{t|0} \bar{\hat{\Psi}}_{t|0} '.
 	\end{equation}
Note that  if eigenvalues of $\overline C$ are positive and strictly less that 1, $\bar{\hat{\Psi}}_{t|0} $ converges to 0.  Using the independence of $\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}$ and $C_t$, and $\hat{\Psi}_t = C_t \hat{\Psi}_{t-1}$, we quickly obtain that for large $t$
 	
%  	\begin{align}
%  		\Sigma_{\Psi,t} &= \mathbb{E}_0\left[\hat{\Psi}_t\hat{\Psi}_t'-B_t \hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'\overline B'-\overline B \hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'B_t'+\overline B\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'\overline B'\right]\nonumber\\
%  		&=\mathbb{E}_0[B_t \hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'B_t']-\overline B\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'\overline B'\nonumber\\
%  		&=\mathbb{E}_0[\sum_s \Pr(s) B(s) \hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}' B(s)']-\overline B\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'\overline B'\nonumber\\
%  		&=\sum_s \Pr(s) B(s)(\Sigma_{\Psi,t-1}+\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}')B(s)-\overline B\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'\overline B'\nonumber\\
%  		&=\sum_s \Pr(s)\left[ B(s)\Sigma_{\Psi,t-1} B(s)' +(B(s)-\overline B)\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'(B(s)-\overline B)'\right]\nonumber\\
%  		&= \mathbb{E}[B\Sigma_{\Psi,t-1}B'] +\mathbb{E}[(B-\overline B)\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}'(B-\overline B)']\label{eq:SigmaFull}
%  	\end{align}
% 	The first term is the transformation of the previous variance by $B$ and the second term is the additional variance introduced by  $B$.  Note, though, that this term depends on $\hat{\Psi}_{t-1}$ being away from $\bm 0$.  Thus, taking the limit as $t\rightarrow\infty$, we obtain
	\begin{equation}
		\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0} \approx \mathbb{E}[C \Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0} C'.] \label{eq:Sigma}
	\end{equation}  Showing that $\hat{\Psi}_{t|0} \rightarrow \bm 0$ in distribution, amounts to showing that $\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0}\rightarrow 0$ for any starting point $\Sigma_{\Psi}$ and following the process in equation (\ref{eq:Sigma}).  One can obtain a necessary condition for $\|\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0}\|\rightarrow 0$ under the process in equation (\ref{eq:Sigma}).
	That process can be rewritten as follows
	\begin{align}
		\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0} &= \mathbb{E}[C \Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0} C']\\
				    &=\sum_s \Pr(s) C(s) \Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0} C(s)'\\
				   &=\sum_s \Pr(s) (\overline C+(C(s)-\overline C))\Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0}(\overline C+(C(s)-\overline C))'\\
				  &=\overline C \Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0}\overline C' +\sum_s\Pr(s) (C(s)-\overline B)\Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0}(C(s)-\overline C)'.\label{eq:sigma_trasnsition}
	\end{align}
% 	
 	This is a deterministic linear system in $\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0}$. Suppose we reshape $\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0}$  as a vector (denoted by $\text{vec}(\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0})$) and let $\hat{C}$ be a (square) matrix such that equation \ref{eq:sigma_trasnsition} is written as
% 	
 \[\text{vec}(\Sigma_{\Psi,t|0})=\hat{C}\text{vec}( \Sigma_{\Psi,t-1|0}).\]	
%
 The stability of this system is guaranteed if the (real part) of eigenvalues of $\hat{C}$ are less than 1.
 \end{proof}

We used theorem \ref{thm: localstability} to verify local stability of a wide range of examples. The typical finding is that the steady state is generically stable and that convergence is slow. In figure \ref{fig: Eigenvalues} we plot the comparative statics for the dominant eigenvalue and the associated  half-life for a two-agent economy with CES preferences. % with respect to the size of the shock and risk aversion.
We set the other parameter to match a Frisch elasticity of 0.5,  a real interest rate of 2\%, marginal tax rates  around 20\%, and a 90-10 percentile ratio of wage earnings of 4. In the first exercise, we vary the size of the expenditure shock keeping risk aversion $\sigma$ at one The $x$- axis plots the spread in expenditure normalized by the undistorted GDP and reported in percentages. In the bottom panel, we fix the size of shock such that it produces a 5\% fall in expenditure fall at risk aversion of one and vary $\sigma$ from 0.8 to 7. We see that the dominant eigenvalue is everywhere less than one but very close to one, so that the steady state is stable but convergence is slow for reasonable values of curvatures and shocks. Both increasing the size of the shock or risk aversion increases the volatility of the interest rates, speeding up the transition towards the steady state.

\subsection{Numerical approximation to a Ramsey plan}\label{appndx: numerical appendix}
This appendix applies a method of \cite{Evans2014} to approximate a Ramsey plan for the $I$ type of agents economy of section \ref{sec: numerical results}. To focus on essential steps, we take a special case where productivities
%\color{red}Tom: I cant read your remark here\color{black}
for agent $i$ are $\log \theta_{i,t}=\log \overline{\theta}_i+\sigma_{\epsilon} \epsilon_t$ and where $\epsilon_t$ is i.i.d with mean zero and variance one.\footnote{Extending the method to more general productivity process as in \eqref{wage equation calibration} is straightforward.}
We will use the following notation for the rmainder of this appendix:

\begin{itemize}

\item Vectors $z_{i,{t-1}} \in \mathcal{R}^{n_z}$ of state variables for agents of type  $i =1, \ldots, I$.
\item Vectors $y_{i,t} \in \mathcal{R}^{n_y}$ of choice variables for agents of type $i =1, \ldots, N$; the vector $y_{i,t}$ often includes components of $z_{i,t}$.
\item A vector $Y_t \in \mathcal{R}^{n_Y}$ of   policy variables chosen by a Ramsey planner
\item A distribution $\Gamma_{t-1}$ over $z_{i,t-1}\in \mathcal{R}^{n_z}$. This can be a measure confined to $I$ mass points. For a $I$ type case with fixed masses of agents and no idiosyncratic risk, $\Gamma_{t-1}$ has all information that is in the set $\{z_{i,t-1}\}_i$. However the algorithm applies for more general economies with idiosyncratic risk, and there the notation $\Gamma_{t-1}$  helps.

\end{itemize}

\noindent A {\em Ramsey plan} can be represented as a set of functions $\left(y,Y,\Gamma\right)$ defining the recursions:
%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: these equations are written in a strange way -- in particular the double occurrence of $\epsilon$ in one of them
%and the use of $\epsilon_t ; \cdot $.  Let's discuss improving this notation please. I haven't touched it though.}

\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqns:Ramsey}
y_{i,t}& =&y_i(\epsilon_t;z_{i,t-1},\Gamma_{t-1},\sigma_{\epsilon}), \quad i=1,\ldots I \cr
Y_{t} & =& Y(\epsilon_t;\Gamma_{t-1},\sigma_{\epsilon}) \cr
\Gamma_{t} & = & \Gamma(\epsilon_t;\Gamma_{t-1})
\end{eqnarray}
%$y_{i,t}=y(\epsilon_t;z_{i,t},\Gamma_{t-1},\sigma_{\epsilon})$, $Y_{t}=y(\epsilon_t;\Gamma_{t-1},\sigma_{\epsilon})$ and $\Gamma_{t}=\Gamma(\epsilon_t;\Gamma_{t-1},\epsilon_t)$.
These functions appropriately
organize solutions to the implementability and optimality conditions associated with a Ramsey plan,  conditions
 that can be expressed in the following forms:
%respectively that solve a collection of the individual optimality equations as in \eqref{individual const} and aggregate market clearing conditions as in \eqref{aggregate const}.
	\begin{equation}
	\label{individual const}
			\EE_{t-1}F(y_{i,t}, \EE_{t-1} y_{i,t}, Y_t, y_{i,t+1} ,\epsilon_t; z_{i,t-1},\sigma_\epsilon) = 0,
	\end{equation}
	which must hold for all $z_{i,t-1}$ such that $\Gamma_{t-1}(z_{i,t-1})>0$; and
		\begin{equation}
	\label{aggregate const}
		\int G(y_{i,t},Y,\epsilon_t;z_{i,t-1},\sigma_\epsilon) d\Gamma_{t-1}= 0	.
	\end{equation}
	The terms $E_{t-1}y_{i,t}$ in equation \eqref{individual const}  capture  constraints requiring  that  subsets of individual decision variables $y_{i,t}$ must be  measurable with respect to time $t-1$ information.
%For the calculations in section \eqref{sec: numerical results}, we construct an approximation to $\{y_t,Y_t,\Gamma_t\}_t$ for a given sequence of aggregate shocks $\epsilon^t$ and some initial $\Gamma_{-1}$.
Our goal is to approximate outcomes generated by the system of equations \eqref{eqns:Ramsey}.  To do this, we
generate a sequence of approximations to the system of equations \eqref{eqns:Ramsey}. We generate the $t\textsuperscript{th}$ outcome along a sample path
by drawing pseudo random vectors $\epsilon_t$ and applying our approximation of equations \eqref{eqns:Ramsey}  for date $t$.
Our approximation to these functions at date $t$ depends on the outcomes $\{z_{i,t-1}\}_i, \Gamma_{t-1}$ generated
at the previous step of the simulation.  To generate functions approximating \eqref{eqns:Ramsey} at date $t$, we use a small-noise
expansion (i.e., around $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0$) to those functions at state $\{z_{i,t-1}\}_i, \Gamma_{t-1}$, an expansion
 that exploits economic properties associated with the limiting $\sigma_\epsilon =0$ economy at that state.
 Thus, to approximate sample paths drawn from the recursive system \eqref{eqns:Ramsey}, we use a sequence of Taylor series approximations around a sequence of points generated
endogenously during a simulation.

\textbf{Anmol, David, and Tom: we need a sentence or two right here describing the virtues of the approximation.}

%\color{blue}\textbf{Anmol XXXXXX: I edited and added the above paragraph.  It surely needs fine tuning. But once polished it will explain in
%a few words what the method is doing.}
\color{black}


The steps of the algorithm proceed sequentially as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Given some $\Gamma_{t-1}$, compute the individual and aggregate choice variables in a limiting economy with $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0$. For our problem, we choose state variables that ensure that  $\Gamma_{t}=\Gamma_{t-1}$ in this limiting economy.\footnote{Extensions to more general environments where there do not exist such steady states or where $\Gamma_t$ follows a deterministic path in the non stochastic limit can be found in \cite{Evans2014}.} The allocation in the limiting economy is a set of values $\left(\{\bar{y}_i,\}_i,\bar{Y}\right)$ that solve\eqref{individual const} and \eqref{aggregate const} at $\sigma_\epsilon=0$. This logic gives us a set of non-linear equations
\begin{equation}
	\label{individual const ss}
			F(\bar y_{i}, \bar{y}_i, \bar{Y}, \bar{y}_i ,0; \bar{z}_{i,t-1},0) = 0  \quad \forall i
	\end{equation}	
	\begin{equation}
	\label{aggregate const ss}
		\int G(\bar{y},\bar{Y},0;z_{i,t-1},\sigma_\epsilon) d\Gamma_{t-1}= 0	
	\end{equation}
whose solution $(\bar{y},\bar{Y})$  depends on $\Gamma_{t-1}$.  It is significant that the ``steady state'' $(\bar{y},\bar{Y})$ would be the outcome
for a complete markets economy  with initial condition $\Gamma_{t-1}$. This follows partly from the fact that when $\sigma_\epsilon=0$,
a risk free bond is enough to complete markets.

	
	\item Next construct a truncated Taylor series approximation to the functions $y, Y$ appearing in \eqref{eqns:Ramsey} around the steady state $\bar{y}(\Gamma_{t-1})$ and $\bar{Y}(\Gamma_{t-1})$ obtained in the step 1; this yields   approximations
	\begin{align}\label{approx ind policies}
y(\epsilon_t;z_{i,t-1},\Gamma_{i,t-1},\sigma_\epsilon) &\approx \bar{y}(\Gamma_{t-1})+ \frac{\partial y}{\partial \epsilon}(0;z_{i,t-1},\Gamma_{t-1},0) \epsilon_t\\\nonumber
					&+  \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial \epsilon^2}(0;z_{i,t-1},\Gamma_{t-1},0)\epsilon_t^2\\ \nonumber
					&+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial \sigma_{\epsilon}^2}(0;z_{i,t-1},\Gamma_{t-1},0) \sigma_{\epsilon}^2
\end{align}and
\begin{align}\label{approx agg policies}			
Y(\epsilon_t;\Gamma_{t-1},\sigma_{\epsilon}) &\approx \bar{Y}(\Gamma_{t-1})+ \frac{\partial Y}{\partial \epsilon}(0;\Gamma_{t-1},0) \epsilon_t\\\nonumber
	&+  \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 Y}{\partial \epsilon_t^2}(0;\Gamma_{t-1},0)\epsilon^2_t\\
					&+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{\partial^2 Y}{\partial \sigma_{\epsilon}^2}(0;\Gamma_{t-1},0)\sigma_{\epsilon}^2. \nonumber
\end{align}	
	The main computational task is to evaluate derivatives at the steady state.  This involves  totally  differentiating
 system \eqref{individual const} and \eqref{aggregate const} at the non stochastic steady state associated with $\Gamma_{t-1}$. \footnote{For large $I$, calculating these derivatives can be further simplified for a class of problems where $\frac{\partial z_{i,t}}{\partial z_{i,t-1}}(0;z_{i,t-1},\Gamma_{t-1},0)$ is independent of $z_{i,t-1}$. In our context this turns out to be an identity matrix.}

\item Draw shocks $\epsilon_t$ and use the approximate policies in \eqref{approx ind policies} and \eqref{approx agg policies} to obtain $y_{i,t}$ and $Y_{t}$. Remember that $z_{i,t}$ is assumed to be included in the vector $y_{i,t}$.  This yields us the next $\Gamma_t$.
\item Advance to $t+1$ and repeat steps 1 to 3 using the updated $\Gamma_{t}$ as the initial distribution.
\end{enumerate}

A key feature of this algorithm is how the points of approximation, and hence the derivatives that capture how agents respond to aggregate shocks, vary along a history. This feature is particularly attractive for problems where the mean of the ergodic distribution can be sufficiently far away from the initial conditions and  the convergence to the ergodic distribution is slow. Since ours is a perturbation approach, handling a high dimensional $z_{i,t-1}$ is more tractable than projection methods using finite order polynomials as basis functions, as in \cite{Judd2011}


\subsubsection{Application to our problem}
We  describe what $\left(y_{i},Y,z_{i}\right)$ and conditions \eqref{individual const} and \eqref{aggregate const} are for our problem.

\begin{itemize}
\item Individual states $z_i= (m_i,\mu_i)$ and the implied distribution $\Gamma$ over $z= (m,\mu)\in \mathbb R^2$ with $I$ mass points,
\item individual's choice variables $y_i = (m_i,\mu_i,c_i,l_i,\phi_i,x_{i}\_,\rho_i,,\psi_{i}\_)$, and
\item planner's aggregate choice variables		$Y = (\tau_l,T,\alpha,\xi,\gamma_-)$,
\end{itemize}

The objects listed above are defined now using modifications of the Bellman equation for $t\geq 1$ that we spelled out in problem \eqref{eq:BM2} in section \ref{sec: two bellman equation}. For convenience in applying our algorithm, we rewrote the Bellman equation.
%Two choices we make are worth noting: firstly we express the problem \eqref{eq:BM2} in section \ref{sec: two bellman equation} in a slightly different manner. Second,  the solutions to $\left(F,G\right)$ in our case have multiple recursive representations in particular with respect to what constitutes as the set of sufficient state variables. We make choices that turn out to be convenient for applying the perturbation method.
 Let $x\_=U^i_c\_b_{i}$ and $m^i\_\propto \frac{1}{U^i_{c}}$ with $\sum_{i}m^i=1$. Note that Ricardian equivalence implies that we can normalize $\sum_{i}\frac{x^i\_}{U^i_c\_}=0$. Thus, the  dimension of the state variables appearing in our modified  Bellman equation is also $2I-2$, as in problem \eqref{eq:BM2} in section \ref{sec: Ramsey Plan}. However, by not normalizing with respect to some arbitrary agent's asset holdings (such as $i=1$), we attain a symmetry that turns out to be convenient.\footnote{This also makes it natural to extend the algorithm to the case with a continuum of agents.}



\noindent The modified Bellman equation for $t\geq 1$ is:



\begin{equation}\label{mod bellman equation}
	V(\vec{x}_-,\vec{m}_{-}) = \max \sum_{s}\left[ \Pi(s) \sum_i \omega^iU(c^i(s),l^i(s)) + \beta V(\vec{x}(s),\vec{m}(s))\right]
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{align}
\mu^i(s):&&	\frac{P(s)U^i_c(s) x^i_{-} }{\beta\EE_- PU^i_c} = U^i_c(s)(c^i(s)-T(s)) + U^i_l(s) l^i(s) + x^i(s)\\\label{mod imp}
\phi^i(s):&&	U^i_c(s)\exp{\epsilon(s)}\theta^i(1-\tau_l(s)) = -U^i_l(s)\\
\rho^i(s):&&	\alpha(s) = m^i(s) U^i_c(s)\\ \label{m def}
\psi^i_{-}:&&	\gamma_-=  m^i_-\EE_- P U^i_c\\ \label{mod asset pricing equation}
\xi(s):&&	\sum_in^i\left[\exp{\epsilon(s)}\theta^il^i(s) - c^i(s)\right] =0\\
	&&\sum_i \frac{x^i(s)}{m^i(s)} = 0\\
	&&\sum_i m^i(s) = 1 \label{normalization m}
\end{align}


Satisfying equation \eqref{m def}  amounts to imposing the definition of $m^i(s)$,  while equation \eqref{mod asset pricing equation} imposes that all agents face the same  price of the asset. In particular, the existence of a $\gamma\_$ that satisfies \eqref{mod asset pricing equation} implies that for any $(i,j)$ pair
\[\frac{m^i\_}{m^j\_}=\frac{\mathbb{E}P U_c^j}{P \mathbb{E} U^i_c}.\]

\noindent Using the definition of $m^i$, we get

\[\frac{U^i_c(s\_)}{U^j_c(s\_)}=\frac{\mathbb{E}P U_c^i}{\mathbb{E}P U_c^j}.\]

\noindent Thus, we see that  equations \eqref{m def} and \eqref{mod asset pricing equation} correspond to equations \eqref{eq:BM2_rhoprime} and \eqref{eq:BM2_Bonds_cons} of the formulation in the \ref{sec: two bellman equation}.
%\textbf{Anmol XXXXX: let's discuss the above and below to make sure it makes sense.  E.G, the presence
%of $\gamma_-$.  }
$\left(F,G\right)$  in \eqref{individual const} and \eqref{aggregate const} become the FOCs of problem \eqref{mod bellman equation} and equations \eqref{mod imp} - \eqref{normalization m}. Solutions to $\left(F,G\right)$ in our model have multiple recursive representations.

In particular, we have alternatives that express allocations as:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item  functions of $(\vec x_-,\vec m_-,s)$ and $\vec\mu_-(\vec x_-,\vec m_-)$ with endogenous law of motion for $(\vec x_-,\vec m_-)$

		or
		
		\item  functions of $(\vec \mu_-,\vec m_-,s)$ and $\vec x_-(\vec \mu_-,\vec m_-)$ with endogenous law of motion for $(\vec \mu_-,\vec m_-)$
	\end{itemize}
We employ the second alternative because when  $\sigma_{\epsilon}=0$, for $I>2$ that there are multiple $\mu\_$ associated with an arbitrary $x\_$ although only one survives in the limit $\sigma_{\epsilon}\to 0$.  However, making $\mu\_$  to be the state retrieves a unique $x\_$.\footnote{We solved in both ways (using projection methods) for $I = 2$ to verify that they produce same allocation.}

 We include productivity processes like equation $\eqref{wage equation calibration}$  by adding an auxiliary aggregate state variable $\mathcal{Q}_t$ that is a vector of length $N$ and that stores the quantiles of productivities of agents $1,2,\ldots,I$, respectively. Its (trivial) law of motion is $\mathcal{Q}_t=\mathcal{Q}_{t-1}$. This allows us to express the vector of wages as a function of the shock and the state variable $\mathcal{Q}_t$.





%We will show later that a convenient choice is keeping track of $\{\mu_{i,t-1}, \frac{U_{c,i,t-1}}{\mathbb{E}_{t-1}U_{c,i,t-1}}$. These are the multipliers associated with

\subsection{Representative agent}
\label{Sec: rep agent}
This section describes the representative agent environment with risky debt and no transfers. The household values consumption and leisure using a quasilinear utility function and
solves
\begin{equation}
W_0(b_{-1})\max_{\{c_t,l_t,b_{t}\}_t}\mathbb{E}_0\beta^t\left \{c_t-\frac{l_t^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}\right\}
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{equation}
c_t+b_{t}=(1-\tau_t)\theta l_t+R_tP_tb_{t-t}
\end{equation}
Using the optimality condition for labor and savings we can summarize the set of implementability constraints for the government as follows
\begin{equation}
\label{rep agent QL seq implementability}
b_{t-1} \frac{P_t}{E_{t-1}P_t}=\mathbb{E}_t\sum_{j}\beta^{t+j}[c_{t+j}-l_{t+j}^{1+\gamma}] \quad \forall t
\end{equation}
We also have the feasibility constraint
\begin{equation}
\label{feasibility}
c_t+g_t\leq\theta l_t,
\end{equation}
and the market clearing for bonds $b_t+B_t=0$.





\noindent The optimal Ramsey allocation solves  $\max_{\{c_t,l_t\}_t}W_0(b_{-1})$ subject to \eqref{rep agent QL seq implementability}, feasibility \eqref{feasibility} and natural debt limits for the government $\underline{B}$\footnote{These will be explicitly derived for the examples we solve in this section.}. For the rest of the note we assume i.i.d exogenous shocks to expenditures denote expenditure and payoffs by $g_t=g(s_t)$and $P_t=P(s_t)$ with the normalization $\mathbb{E}P(s)=1$


\begin{theorem}
\label{rep agent general payoffs}

Suppose $P(s)$ satisfies \[P(s)-P(s')>\beta \frac{g(s)-g(s')}{\underline{B}} \quad \forall \quad s,s, \] there exists an invariant distribution of assets with unbounded support. Further for large enough assets (or debt) there is a drift towards the interior region.

In particular $V$ is strictly concave and there exists $\underline{B}>B_1>B_2>-\infty$ such that

\[\mathbb{E}V'(B(s))>V'(B\_) \quad B\_>B_2 \]
and
\[\mathbb{E}V'(B(s))<V'(B\_) \quad B\_<B_1 \]

\end{theorem}


\begin{theorem}
\label{rep agent policy}
For the two special payoff structures, the optimal tax and asset policies $\{\tau_t,B_t\}_t$ are characterized as follows,
\begin{enumerate}
\item If $P(s)=1$
\[\lim_t \tau_t=-\infty, \quad \lim_t B_t=\infty    \quad a.s\]
\item If $P(s) = 1+ \frac{\beta}{ B^*}(g(s) - \mathbb{E} g)$ \quad for some $B^*\geq\underline{B}$
\[\lim_t \tau_t=\tau^*>\infty, \quad \lim_tB_t=  B^*\quad a.s \quad \forall B_{-1} \]

\end{enumerate}

\end{theorem}
%When the risky payoff on the bond $P(s)$ perfectly spans $g(s)$,
\begin{remark}
In the case where payoffs are perfectly correlated with expenditure shocks (case 2), we can express the long run assets \[B^*=\beta \frac{\var(g(s))}{\cov(P(s),g(s))}\]. Keeping tax rates (and hence tax revenues in this case) the government needs to finance a higher primary deficit when it gets positive expenditure shock. If in such states the assets pays off more, then optimally the government holds positive assets and uses the these high returns to finance this deficit. On the other hand if payoff are lower in times when the government needs resources, holding debt is valuable since it lowers the interest burden. Thus using the level of its assets $B^*$ it can perfectly span the fluctuations in deficits and the sign is given by the sign of the covariance of $P(s)$ with $g(s)$


The long run tax rate is inversely related to $B^*$ with the following limits,\[\lim_{B^*\to\underline{B}}\tau^*=\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}\quad \lim_{B^*\to\infty}\tau^*=-\infty\]

\end{remark}


\begin{corollary}
Let $\underline{B}>-\infty$ be the natural debt limit for the government. Suppose we impose an upper bound on assets $\overline{B}<\infty$,

\begin{enumerate}
\item If $P(s) = 1+ \frac{\beta}{ B^*}(g(s) - \mathbb{E} g)$ \quad for some $\overline{B}>B^*\geq\underline{B}$
\[\exists \epsilon>0, \quad \Pr\{B_t<\underline{B}+\epsilon \text{ or } B_t>\overline{B}-\epsilon\}=0\]

\item For all other payoffs
\[\forall \epsilon>0, \quad \Pr\{B_t<\underline{B}+\epsilon \text{ and } B_t>\overline{B}-\epsilon \}=1\]
\end{enumerate}

\end{corollary}






\begin{theorem}
\label{rep agent ergodic distribution}
Consider a orthogonal decomposition of $P(s)$ as follows
\[P(s)=\hat{P}(s)+P^*(s)\] where
\[
  P^*(s) = 1+\frac{\beta}{B^*}( g - \mathbb{E} g) \text{ for some } B^*\geq \underline{B}
\]
and $\hat{P}(s)$ is orthogonal to $g(s)$. Expanding the policy rules around the steady state of the $P^*(s)$ economy we have the following characterization,

\begin{itemize}
 \item The ergodic distribution of debt of the policy rules linearized around $(B^*, P^*(s))$ will have mean $B^*$,
 \item The coefficient of variation is given by
  \[
    \frac{\sigma(B)}{\mathbb E(B)} = \sqrt\frac{\var(P(s)) - |\cov(g(s),P(s))|}{(1+|\cov(g(s),P(s))|)|\cov(g(s),P(s))|}\leq\sqrt\frac{\var(P(s)) - |\cov(g(s),P(s))|}{|\cov(g(s),P(s))|}
  \]
  \item The speed of convergence to the ergodic distribution described by
  \[
    \frac{\EE_{t-1}(B_t-B^*)}{(B_{t-1} - B^*)} = \frac1{1+|\cov(P(s),g(s))|}
  \]

\end{itemize}


\end{theorem}





\subsection{Heterogeneous agent: Quasilinear unproductive agent}
Suppose the unproductive agent has quasilinear preferences and we additionally impose a non negativity constraint on his consumption.
\begin{theorem}
Let $\omega,n$ be the Pareto weight and mass of the productive agent with $n<\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$. The government trades a risky bond with payoffs $P(s)$ and faces i.i.d expenditure shocks.  The optimal tax, transfer and asset policies $\{\tau_t,T_t,B_t\}$ are characterized as follows,


\begin{enumerate}
 \item For $\omega\geq n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$ we have  $T_t=0$ and the optimal policy is same as in a representative agent economy studied in theorems \ref{rep agent general payoffs}, \ref{rep agent policy} and \ref{rep agent ergodic distribution}
 \item For $\omega< n \left(\frac{1+\gamma}{\gamma}\right)$, suppose we further assume that $\min_{s}\{P(s)\}>\beta$. We have two parts:

 There exists $\mathcal{B}(\omega)$ and $\tau^*(\omega)$ with $\mathcal{B}'(\omega)>0$ and $\lim_{\omega\to 0}\mathcal{B}(\omega)<0$ such that
 \begin{enumerate}
  \item $B\_>\mathcal{B(\omega)}$
\[T_t>0, \quad \tau_t=\tau^*(\omega), \textit{ and } B_t=B\_ \quad \forall t\]
\item $B\_\leq \mathcal{B(\omega)}$, the policies depend on the structure of $P(s)$.
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For a risky bond with $P(s) = 1+ \frac{\beta}{ B^*}(g(s) - \mathbb{E} g)$ \quad for some $B^*<\mathcal{B}(\omega)$ we have two cases depending on $B\_$
\begin{enumerate}
 \item For $B\_\leq B^*$
 \[T_t = 0, \quad \lim_t \tau_t=\tau^{**} (\omega), \textit{ and } \lim_tB_t=  B^*\quad a.s \]

\item For all other payoffs
   \[\lim_t T_t=0 \text{ i.o.},\quad \lim_t\tau_t=\tau^*(\omega) \text{ and } \lim_tB_t=\mathcal{B}(\omega)\quad \textit{a.s}\]

\section{Old Discussion}


The purpose of this note is to study the roles of transfers and debt as tools to hedge aggregate shocks in presence of  incomplete markets.

We begin with the representative agent model studied in AMSS and make two changes:  first, the government trades a ``risky'' bond and second, the government  is prohibited
from using transfers. The ``risky'' bond is a security whose payoffs $P_t(s^t)$ are correlated with the aggregate shocks. This feature allows us to vary the government's ability to span aggregate shocks while keeping markets incomplete. Below we will characterize two polar cases analytically: a) risk-free bond where $P_t(s^t)=1$ and b) perfect spanning where $\corr(P_t,g_t)=\pm 1$. Lastly we develop an approximation result for intermediate cases.

The main finding is that  the  levels and fluctuations in tax rates and government debt are both
driven by the covariance between  payoff on the bonds and the exogenous  needs for revenue  driven by exogenous government purchases.
With perfect spanning, the joint distribution of  long-run debt and taxes is degenerate, taxes and debt both  diverge in an economy with only
a risk-free bond being traded. The approximation result allows us to estimate the rates of convergence and volatility of debt and taxes for intermediate cases.

The restriction on transfers is meant to capture costs of using this instrument to hedge aggregate shocks. So far these costs are {\em ad hoc}
and assumed to be arbitrarily high. In the next section we endogenize these costs by adding concerns for redistribution and  allowing the government to choose transfers optimally. These concerns are be modeled by adding a positive
mass of unproductive but risk averse agents and assigning to  them a non-zero Pareto weight. Under the assumption that the government trades a risk free bond\footnote{The results for arbitrary payoffs extend analogously, i.e with perfect spanning the government eventually smooths fluctuations in both taxes and transfers.}
we construct two limiting cases of a representative agent economy by varying the mass of either type of agent.

The key insight is that the welfare costs of using fluctuating transfers to hedge aggregate shocks comes from
the presence (and mass) of the unproductive risk averse agents. As their mass vanishes,
the optimal policy smooths labor taxes and all shocks are hedged by fluctuating transfers.
In this case, asymptotically transfers diverge and tax rates approach zero. But when the mass of the productive agents is low,
limiting transfers are constant. Eventually as their mass goes to zero, the optimal policy has unbounded labor subsidies and the level of transfers approaches zero.
In both cases the implied government assets (under the normalization that the unproductive agent holds no assets) diverge.

These limits can be contrasted with an alternative economy in which  the unproductive agents have quasilinear preferences and
we impose a non-negativity constraint on their consumption. As the mass of these unproductive agents approaches zero,
limiting taxes are constant (they approach zero if their Pareto weight approaches zero too) but transfers are also zero infinitely often. The government accumulates a  finite level assets (typically positive). Thus the limiting allocation is similar to  that studied in AMSS with a non-negativity constraint on transfers where the government eventually accumulates first best level of assets. However, in our case these levels vary  inversely with the governments' preferences for redistribution and can switch signs for a low enough Pareto weight
on the productive agent. More regressive governments employ
tax subsidies and deficits that are financed by issuing debt. The optimal policy uses transfers as against accumulating assets to hedge aggregate shocks.

\section{Results left on the cutting board}

Besides the results mentioned before we have some things we proved that I could not fit. They mainly pertain to existence of steady state for more general preferences and shocks. I list them in this section


\subsection{Persistence}
\begin{theorem}
Consider a representative agent model studied in section \ref{Sec: rep agent} but with persistence shocks. For every complete market allocation indexed by $\mu^*$ there exists a payoff vector $P(s)$ such that there exists a  steady state in the risky debt economy that supports the same allocation. For an arbitrary payoff vector $P(s)$ (generically) there exists a steady state only if $\|S\|=2$
\end{theorem}


\subsection{Risk Aversion}
We have some scattered results for risk aversion and existence of steady state.
\begin{theorem}
Assume that $U$ is  separable and iso-elastic,	 $U(c,l) = \frac{c^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma} -\frac{ l^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}$.
and shocks are i.i.d with $s_b$  being the ``adverse'' state (either low TFP or high govt. expenditures)
and $s_g$ begin the good state. Let $x_{fb}$ be the discounted present value of marginal utility weighted government surpluses associated with the first best allocation.
%\st{ be a value of  %\st{the state $x$ from which a government can implement first=best with complete markets}
%marginal utility weighted debt associated with the first-best allocation with complete markets.}\tjs{David: the phrase
%``first-best allocation with complete markets'' remains imprecise?  What does it mean?}
	 Let $q_{fb}(s)$ be the shadow price of government debt in state $s$ at the first best allocation.
	If
	\begin{equation}\label{eqn:prop52sufficient}
		\frac{1-q_{fb}(s_b)}{1-q_{fb}(s_g)} > \frac{g(s_b)}{g(s_g)}\geq 1 ,
	\end{equation}
		then there exists a steady state with $x_{fb}>x^*>0$
		\end{theorem}



\begin{theorem}
\label{thm long run forces}
Consider an economy consisting of  two types of households with $%
\theta _{1,t}>\theta _{2,t}=0$. One period utilities are $\ln c-\frac{1}{2}%
l^{2}.$ The shock $s$  is i.i.d and takes  two values, $s\in \left\{
s_{L},s_{H}\right\}.$ We assume that $g\left( s\right) =g$ for all $s,$
and $\theta _{1}\left( s_{H}\right) >\theta _{1}\left( s_{L}\right) .$ We allow the discount factor $\beta(s)$ to depend on  $s.$

\smallskip Suppose that $g<\theta (s)$ for all $%
s.$ Let $R(s)$ be the gross interest rates and $x=U^2_c(s)\left[b_2(s)-b_1(s)\right]$

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Countercyclical interest rates.} If $\beta \left( s_{H}\right) =\beta \left( s_{L}\right)$, then
there exists a steady state $\left( x^{SS},\rho ^{SS}\right) $ such that $%
x^{SS}>0,\ R^{SS}\left( s_{H}\right) <R^{SS}\left( s_{L}\right) .$
\item \textbf{Acyclical interest rates.}  There exists a pair $\left\{ \beta \left( s_{H}\right) ,\beta \left( s_{L}\right)
\right\} $ such that there exists a steady state with $x^{SS}>0$ and $R^{SS}\left(
s_{H}\right) =R^{SS}\left( s_{L}\right)$.
\item \textbf{Procyclical interest rates.} There exists a pair  $\left\{ \beta \left( s_{H}\right) ,\beta \left( s_{L}\right)
\right\} $ such that there exists a steady state with $x^{SS}<0$ and  $R^{SS}\left( s_{H}\right) >R^{SS}\left( s_{L}\right) .$
\end{enumerate}
In all cases, taxes $\tau(s)=\tau^{SS}$ are independent of the realized state.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
 We can extend this result to the case with payoff shocks instead of discount factor shocks
\end{remark}
		
\begin{theorem}
\label{theorem}

Suppose the Pareto weight of the agents are interior and we normalize the assets of the unproductive agent to zero.
Let $n \in [0,1]$ denote the mass of the productive agents. The optimal tax, transfer and debt policy $\{\tau_t,T_t,B_t\}_t$ is characterized as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item As $n\to 0$,
\[\lim_t T_t=0,\quad \lim_t\tau_t=-\infty.\]
\item As $n\to 1$,
\[\lim_t T_t=\infty,\quad \lim_t\tau_t=0.\]
\end{enumerate}
In both cases limiting government assets, $\lim_tB_t=\infty$

{\textbf{Theorem 1}}
\begin{proof}




The optimal Ramsey plan solves the following Bellman equation. Let $V(b\_)$ be the maximum ex-ante value the government can achieve with debt $b\_$.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-QLRA obj}
    V(b\_)=\max_{c(s),l(s),b(s)} \sum_{s}\pi(s)\left\{c(s)-\frac{l(s)^{1+\gamma}}{1+\gamma}+\beta V(b(s)) \right\}
\end{equation}
subject to

   \begin{subequations}
   \label{sys- QLRA constraint}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{rep agent implementability constraint }
    c(s)+b(s)=l(s)^{1+\gamma}+\beta^{-1} P(s)b\_
    \end{equation}



\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-resoruces}
c(s)+g(s)\leq\theta l(s)
\end{equation}
Let $\bar{b}=-\underline{B}$
\begin{equation}
  \label{ndl}
b\leq \bar{b}
\end{equation}


   \end{subequations}
Let $\mu(s)\pi(s),\phi(s)\pi(s)$ be the Lagrange multipliers on the respective constraints.


\begin{lemma}
There exists  a $\overline{b}$ such that $b_t\leq\overline{b}$. This is the natural debt limit for the government.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
As we drive $\mu$ to $-\infty$, the tax rate approaches a maximum limit, $\bar{\tau}=\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$. In state $s$, the government surplus,
\[
  S(s,\tau) = \theta^\frac\gamma{1+\gamma}(1-\tau)^\frac1\gamma\tau - g(s),
\]  which  is  maximized at $\tau = \frac\gamma{1+\gamma}$ when $(1-\tau)^\frac1\gamma\tau$ is also maximized. This would impose a natural borrowing limit for the government.

\end{proof}

We begin with some useful lemmas

\smallskip To make this problem convex, let $L\equiv l^{1+\gamma }.$

Substitute for $c\left( s\right) $%
\[
V\left( b\_\right) =\max_{L(s),b(s)}\sum_{s\in S}\pi \left(
s\right) \left[ \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L\left( s\right) +\frac{1}{\beta }%
P\left( s\right) b\_-b\left( s\right) +\beta V\left( b\left( s\right)
\right) \right]
\]%
s.t.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
\frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b-b\left( s\right) +g\left( s\right) &\leq
&\theta L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\left( s\right) -L\left( s\right) \\
b\left( s\right) &\leq &\bar{b} \\
L\left( s\right) &\geq &0.
\end{eqnarray*}

\begin{lemma}
\smallskip $V\left( b\right) $ is stictly concave, continuous,
differentiable and $V\left( b\right) <\beta ^{-1}$ for all $%
b<\bar{b}.$ The feasibility constraint binds for all $b\in (-\infty ,\bar{b}%
],\ s\in S$ and $\left( L^{\ast }\left( s\right) \right) ^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\geq
\frac{1}{1+\gamma} .\footnote{
This last condition simply means that we do not tax to the right of the peak
of the Laffer curve. The revenue maximizing tax is $1-\bar{\tau}=\frac{1}{%
1+\gamma }.$ At the same time $1-\tau =l^{\gamma}$ so if taxes are always
to the left of the peak, $\frac{1}{1+\gamma }\leq l^{\gamma }=\left(
L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\right) ^{\gamma}=L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }$.}$
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
\smallskip \textit{Concavity}

$V\left( b\right) $ is concave because we maximize linear objective
function over convex set.

\textit{Binding feasibility}

Suppose that feasibility does not bind for some $b,s.$ Then the optimal $%
L\left( s\right) $ solve $\max_{L\left( s\right) \geq 0}\pi \left( s\right)
\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma }L\left( s\right) $ which sets $L\left( s\right)
=\infty .$ This violates feasility for any finite $b,b\left( s\right) .$

\textit{Bounds on }$L$

Let $\phi\left( s\right) >0$ be a Lagrange multiplier on the
feasibility. \ The FOC for $L\left( s\right) $ is
\[
\frac{1}{1+\gamma }+\phi(s) \left( \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L(s)^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma}
-}-\theta \right) =0.
\]%
This gives%
\[
\frac{1}{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} -1}-\theta =-\frac{1}{\lambda }\frac{\gamma}{%
1+\gamma }<0
\]%
or%
\[
L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\geq \frac{\theta }{1+\gamma }.
\]

\textit{Continuity}

For any $L$ that satisfy $L^{1-\frac{}{1+\gamma} }\geq \frac{\theta }{1+\gamma} ,$ define function $%
\Psi $ that satisfies $\Psi \left( L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }-\theta L\right) =L.$ Since $%
L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }-L$ is strictly decreasing in $L$ for $L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }\geq
\frac{1}{1+\gamma} $, this function is well defined. Note that $\Psi \left(
{}\right) \underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} -1}-\theta \right) }%
_{<0}=1$ (so that $\Psi >0$, i.e. $\Psi $ is strictly decreasing)
and $\Psi ^{\prime \prime }\underbrace{\left( \frac{1}{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma}
-1}-1\right) ^{2}}_{>0}+\underbrace{\Psi }_{<0}\underbrace{\frac{1%
}{1+\gamma }\frac{\gamma }{1+\gamma }L^{\frac{1}{1+\gamma} -2}}_{<0}=0$ (so that $\Psi
^{\prime \prime }\geq 0$, $\Psi ^{\prime \prime }>0,$ i.e. $\Psi $ is
strictly concave on the interior). $\Psi $ is also continuous. When $%
L^{1-\frac{1}{1+\gamma} }=\frac{1}{1+\gamma} ,$ $L=(1+\gamma) ^{-\frac{(1+\gamma)} {\left( \gamma \right)} }.$
Let $D\equiv (1+\gamma) ^{\frac{-1}{ \gamma }-(1+\gamma) ^{-\frac{1+\gamma }{\left(\gamma\right)} }}.$ Then the objective is
\[
V\left( b\_\right) =\max_{b\left( s\right) }\sum_{s\in S}\pi \left(
s\right) \left[ \Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b-b\left(
s\right) +g\left( s\right) \right) +\frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right)
b\_-b\left( s\right) +\beta V\left( b\left( s\right) \right) \right]
\]%
s.t.%
\begin{eqnarray*}
b\left( s\right) &\leq &\bar{b} \\
\frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b\_-b\left( s\right) +g\left( s\right) &\leq
&D.
\end{eqnarray*}

This function is continuous so $V$ is also continuous.

\textit{Differentiability}

Continuity and convexity implies differentiability everywhere, including the
boundaries.

\textit{Strict concavity}

$\Psi $ is strictly concave, so on the interior $V$ is strictly
concave.

\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
With $P(s)=1$, the multiplier on the implementability constraint,$\lim_t\mu_t=\mu*$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}


The envelope theorem together with the FOC with respect to $b(s)$ imply that the multiplier on the implementability constraint is a martingale

\[\mathbb{E}\mu_{t+1}=\mu_t\]

The FOC with respect to labor $l(s)$ can be expressed as

\[\mu=\frac{\frac{\theta}{l^{\gamma}-1}}{\frac{\theta}{l^{\gamma}-(1+\gamma)}}\]. Note that $(1-\tau)^{-1}=\theta/l^{\gamma}$. Thus, as tax rates go to $-\infty$, $\mu$ approaches $\frac{1}{1+\gamma}$ from below.

Given this bound, the standard martingale convergence theorems imply that $\mu\to \mu^*$ almost surely.
\end{proof}



We first show that  if $\mu^*=\frac{1}{1+\gamma}$, $b_t\to-\infty$ and then argue that $\mu^*$ cannot converge to any other value.



Strict concavity of $V$ implies $\mu$ converges, either $b_t$ converges to a constant or diverges to $-\infty$. Suppose $\lim_tb_t$ is finite. The government's budget constraint would imply

\begin{equation}
\label{gbc}
\lim_t \tau_t\theta l_t-\lim_tg_t=(\beta^{-1}-1)\lim_t b_t
\end{equation}



However the left hand side of the previous expression diverges to $-\infty$. However under the hypothesis the right hand side is finite. This gives us a contradiction and hence $\lim_tb_t=-	\infty$.

Now suppose $\mu^*<\frac{1}{1+\gamma}$. Again strict concavity of $V$ implies $\lim_t b^*>-\infty$.  However, labor supply and taxes will be constant and finite in the limit. Thus, the left hand side of \eqref{gbc} is stochastic and the right hand side approaches a constant. This yields a contradiction.


Thus, combining the above, $\mu^*=\frac{1}{1+\gamma}$ and $\lim_tb_t=-\infty$.







The second part of the theorem is to prove convergence to $B^*$ for a the class of payoffs that are perfectly aligned with the expenditure shocks. We first begin with some characterization of the policy rules
\smallskip Next we characterize policy functions

\begin{lemma}
\label{lem increasing b}
$b\left( b\_,s\right) $ is an increasing function of $b$ for all $s$ for all $%
\left( b\_,s\right) $ where $b\left( s\right) $ is interior.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Take the FOCs for $b\left( s\right) $ from the condition in the previous
problem. If $b\left( s\right) $ is interior%
\[
\Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b\_-b\left( s\right)
+g\left( s\right) \right) =\beta V\left( b\left( s\right)
\right) .
\]

Suppose $b_{1}<b_{2}$ but $b_{2}\left( s\right) <b_{1}\left( s\right) .$
Then from stict concavity%
\begin{eqnarray*}
V\left( b_{2}\left( s\right) \right) &<&V^{\prime
}\left( b_{1}\left( s\right) \right) \\
\Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }P\left( s\right) b_{2}-b_{2}\left(
s\right) +g\left( s\right) \right) &>&\Psi \left( \frac{1}{\beta }%
P\left( s\right) b_{1}-b_{1}\left( s\right) +g\left( s\right) \right) .
\end{eqnarray*}
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}  Let $\mu(b,s)$ be the optimal policy function for the Lagrange multiplier $\mu(s)$.  If $P(s') > P(s'')$ then there exists a $b^*_{s',s''}$ such that for all $b < (>) \; b_{1,s',s''}$ we have $\mu(b,s') > (<) \;\mu(b,s'')$.  If $\underline b < b^*_{s',s''} < \overline b$ then $\mu(b^*_{s',s''},s') = \mu(b^*_{s',s''},s'')$.
\label{lem.order}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Suppose that $\mu(b,s')\leq \mu(b,s'')$.  Subtracting the implementability for $s''$ from the implementability constraint for $s'$ we have
\begin{align*}
	\frac{P(s')-P(s'')}{\beta}b &= S_{s'}(\mu(b,s'))-S_{s''}(\mu(b,s'')) + b'(b,s')-b'(b,s'')\\
						&\geq S_{s'}(\mu(b,s')) -S_{s''}(\mu(b,s')) + b'(b,s')-b'(b,s'')\\
						&\geq  S_{s'}(\mu(b,s')) -S_{s''}(\mu(b,s')) = g(s'')-g(s')
\end{align*}  We get the first inequality from noting that $S_s(\mu')\geq S_s(\mu'')$ if $\mu' \leq \mu''$.  We obtain the second inequality by noting that $\mu(b,s')\leq \mu(b,s'')$ implies $b'(b,s')\geq b'(b,s'')$ (which comes directly from the concavity of $V$).
Thus, $\mu(b,s')\leq \mu(b,s'')$ implies that
\[
	b \geq \frac{\beta(g(s'')-g(s'))}{P(s')-P(s'')} = b^*_{s',s''}
\]The converse of this statement is that if $b<b^*_{s',s''}$ then $\mu(b,s') > \mu(b,s'')$.  The reverse statement that $\mu(b,s') \geq \mu(b,s'')$ implies $b \leq b^*_{s,s'}$ follows by symmetry.   Again, the converse implies that if $b > b^*_{s',s''}$ then $\mu(b,s') < \mu(b,s'')$.    Finally, if $\underline b < b^*_{s',s''} <\overline b$ then continuity of the policy functions implies that there must exist a root of $\mu(b,s')-\mu(b,s'')$ and that root can only be at $b^*_{s',s''}$.
\end{proof}

The FOC and the envelope theorem now modify the martingale equation for $\mu_t$ as follows,
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.mart}
\sum_{s}\pi(s)P(s)\mu(s)=\mu\_
\end{equation}

With Lemma \ref{lem.order} we can order the policy functions $\mu(b,\cdot)$ for particular regions of the state space.  Take $b_1$ to be
\[
	b_1 = \min\left\{b^*_{s',s''}\right\}
\] and WLOG choose $\underline b < b_1$.  For all $b < b_1$ we have shown that $P_s > P(s')$ implies that $\mu(b,s) > \mu(b,s')$.  By decomposing $\EE \mu_{t+1}P_{t+1}$ in equation \eqref{eq.mart}, we obtain (using $\EE_t P_{t+1} = 1$)
\begin{equation}
	\mu_t = \EE\mu_{t+1} +\cov_t(\mu_{t+1},P_{t+1})
\end{equation}Our analysis has just shown that for $b_t < b_1$ we have $\cov_t (\mu_{t+1},P_{t+1})  >0$ so
\[
	\mu_t > \EE_t\mu_{t+1}.
\]  If $p$ is sufficiently volatile:
\[
	P(s') - P(s'') > \frac{\beta(g(s'')-g(s'))}{\overline b}
\] then
\[
	b_2 = \max\left\{b^*_{s',s''}\right\} <\overline b
\] and through a similar argument  we can conclude that $\cov_t(\mu_{t+1},P_{t+1}) < 0$
\[
	\mu_t < \EE_t \mu_{t+1}
\] for $b_t > b_2$


\begin{lemma}
For payoff structures of the form
if \[
  P(s) = 1 + \alpha(g(s)- \EE g)\]
 then  there exists a unique $b^*$ such that $b(b^*,s)=b^*$ for all $s$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This follows from taking differences of the \eqref{rep agent implementability constraint } for $s'$,$s''$. We have
\[[P(s)-P(s'')]\frac{b^*}{\beta}=g(s)-g(s'')\]
We have used the fact that if $b(b^*,s)$ is invariant across states, $\mu(s)=\mu^*$ and this implies that tax rates are constant. Thus, the fluctuations in the surplus of the government only come from $g(s)$.

\end{proof}

Since are payoffs $P(s)$ in this second part are linear in $g(s)$, we can immediately see that by setting $\alpha=\frac{\beta}{b^*}$



\begin{lemma}
\label{sub super martingale}
$\mu_t$  is a sub-martingale bounded above in the region $(-\infty,\mu^*)$ and super-martingale bounded below in the region $(\mu^*,\frac{1}{1+\gamma})$


\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\mu^*$ be the associated multiplier, i.e $V_b(b^*)=\mu^*$.  Using the results of the previous section, we have that $b_1 = b_2 = b^*$, implying that $\mu_t < (>) \EE_t\mu_{t+1}$ for $b_t  < (>) b^*$.
\end{proof}

Lastly we show that $\lim_t \mu_t=\mu^*$. Suppose $b_{t}<b^*$, we know that $\mu_t>\mu^*$. The previous lemma implies that in this region, $\mu_t$ is a super martingale. The lemma $\ref{lem increasing b}$ shows that $b(b\_,s)$ is continuous and increasing. This translates into $\mu(\mu(b\_),s)$ to be continuous and increasing as well.
 Thus
 \[\mu_{t}>\mu^* \implies \mu(\mu_{t},s_{t+1})>\mu(\mu^*,s_{t+1}) \]
or
 \[\mu_{t+1}>\mu^*\]
Thus $\mu*$  provides a lower bound to this super martingale. Using standard martingale convergence theorem converges. The uniqueness of steady state implies that it can only converge to $\mu^*$. For $\mu<\mu^*$, the argument is symmetric.



\end{proof}

{\textbf{Corollary 1}}


\begin{proof}
Here we show that for $P(s)=1$ we show that with probability one, $b_t$ gets arbitrary close to both the boundaries. Adding a lower bound to debt imposes a constraint
\begin{equation}
\label{bound on b}
b(s)\geq\underline{b}
\end{equation}
The foc with respect to $b(s)$ will now be modified to

\[\beta \pi(s) V'(b(s))+\pi(s)\kappa(s)=\mu(s)\]
where $\kappa(s)$ is the Lagrange multiplier on the \eqref{bound on b}.  We first show a lemma that allows us to strictly order $b(b\_,s)$ across $s$

\begin{lemma}
\label{prop: b(s) relative to b}For any $b\_\in (-\underline{b} ,\bar{b}),$ there are $s,s^{\prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left( s\right) \geq b\_\geq b\left( s^{\prime \prime }\right) .$ Moreover, if there are any states $s^{\prime \prime },s^{\prime \prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left( s^{\prime \prime
}\right) \neq b\left( s^{\prime \prime \prime }\right) ,$ those inequalities
are strict.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof}
The FOCs together with the envelope theorem imply that $\mathbb{E}P(s)V'(b(s))=V'(b\_)+\kappa(s)$
We can rewrite this as $\mathbb{\tilde{E}}V'(b(s))=b+\kappa(s)$ with $\tilde{\pi}(s)=P(s)\pi(s)$

Now if there is at least one $b\left( s\right) $ s.t. $b\left(
s\right) >b\_,$ by strict concavity of $V$ there must be some $%
s^{\prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left( s^{\prime \prime }\right) <b.$

If there is at least one $b\left( s\right) $ s.t. $b\left(
s\right) <b\_,$ the inequality above is strictly only if $b\left(
s^{\prime \prime \prime }\right) =\bar{b}$ for some $s^{\prime \prime \prime
}.$ But $V\left( \bar{b}\right) <V\left(
b\right) $ so there must be some $s^{\prime \prime }$ s.t. $b\left(
s^{\prime \prime }\right) >b.$ Equality is possible only if $b\_=b\left(
s\right) $ for all $s.$
\end{proof}

For payoffs $P(s)=1$, it is easy to see that there does not exists any $b^*$ in the interior that has the property $b(b^*,s)=b^*$. Thus, the relevant inequalities in the previous lemma are strict. This allows us to construct a sequences $\{b_t\}_t $ such that $b_t<b_{t+1}$ with the property that $\lim_tb_t=\underline{b}$.
Thus, for any $\epsilon>0$, there exists a finite history of shocks that can take us arbitrarily close to $\underline{b}$. Since the shocks are i.i.d this finite sequence will repeat i.o. With a symmetric argument we can show that $b_t$ will come arbitrarily close to its upper limit i.o too




The second part of the corollary states that $P(s)=1+\frac{\beta}{B^*}(g(s)-\mathbb{E}g)$ then we never approach the boundaries. This essentially follows from lemma \ref{sub super martingale}. We have the covariance $\cov(\mu_{t+1},P(s_{t+1})<0$ for $\mu<\mu^*$ and vice versa. The only change is that the martingale equation for $\mu$ will read
\[\mathbb{E}\mu_{t+1}=\mu_t-\cov(\mu_{t+1},P(s_{t+1})-\kappa_{t+1}\]

Note that for $\mu<\mu^*$ $\kappa_{t+1}$ will be zero and the analysis is same as before. For $\mu>\mu^*$ we have the covariance term positive and the Lagrange multiplier positive too. Thus
\[\mathbb{E}\mu_{t+1}<\mu_t\]
Thus, it remains a super-martingale drifting towards $\mu^*$.
\end{proof}



{\textbf{Theorem 2}}
\begin{proof}
The first order conditions for a planning problem given portfolio $p_s$ are given by
\begin{align*}
	\frac{b p_s}{\beta \EE p}= S(\mu'(s),s) + b'(s)\\
	V'(b) = \frac{\EE p \mu'}{\EE p}\\
	\mu'(s) = V'(b'(s))
\end{align*} where $S(\mu,s)$ is the government surplus in state $s$ given by
\[
	S(\mu,s) = (1-\tau(\mu))^\frac1\gamma \tau(\mu)-g(s) = I(\mu) - g(s)
\]where
\[
	\tau(\mu) =\frac{\gamma\mu}{(1+\gamma)\mu-1}
\]We note that $V'(b)$ is one-to-one, so we can re-characterize these equations as searching for a function $b(\mu)$ such that the following two equations can be solved for all $\mu$.
\begin{align}\label{eq.lin_imp}
	\frac{b(\mu)p_s}{\beta \EE p} = I(\mu'(s)) - g(s) +b(\mu'(s))\\
	\mu = \frac{\EE\mu' p}{\EE p}\label{eq.lin_mart}
\end{align}  This defines, implicitly, a function $b(\mu; p)$ .  For a given $\overline \mu$ define
\[
	\overline b = \frac{\beta}{1-\beta}\left( I(\overline\mu) - \overline g\right)
\]where $\overline g = \EE g$ and $\overline p$ as
\[
	\overline p_s = 1+ \frac\beta{\overline b}(g_s - \overline g)
\]  As noted before $b(\overline\mu;\overline p) = \overline b$ solves the the system of equations (\ref{eq.lin_imp}-\ref{eq.lin_mart}) for $\mu'(s) = \overline \mu$.  We can linearize around this steady state with respect to both $\mu$ and $p$.  Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_imp} with respect to $\mu$ around $(\overline \mu,\overline p)$ we obtain
\[
	\frac{\pbar_s}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu} = \left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu}\right]\frac{\partial \mu'(s)}{\partial \mu}.
\]Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_mart} with respect to $\mu$ we obtain
\[
	1 = \sum_{s'} \Pi_s \overline p_s \frac{\partial \mu'(s)}{\partial \mu}
\]combining these two equations we see that
\[
	\frac1\beta\left(\sum_s\Pi_s\pbar_s^2\right)\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu} = I'(\mubar) + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu}
\]Noting that $\EE\overline p^2 = 1 + \frac{\beta^2}{\bbar^2}\sigma^2_g$ we obtain
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu} = \frac{I'(\mubar)}{\frac{\beta}{\bbar^2}\sigma_g^2 +\frac{1-\beta}{\beta}} < 0
\end{equation}as $I'(\mubar) < 0$.  We then have directly that
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \mu'(s)}{\partial \mu} = \frac{\overline p_s}{\frac{\beta^2}{\overline b^2}\sigma^2_g +1} = \frac{\pbar_s}{\EE\pbar^2}
\end{equation}  We can perform the same procedure for $p_s$.  Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_imp} with respect to $p_s$ we around $(\mubar,\pbar)$ we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{eq.dimp_dps}
\frac{\pbar_{s'}}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial p_s} + 1_{s,s'}\frac{\bbar}{\beta} - \frac{\Pi_s\bbar\pbar_{s'}}{\beta} = \left[I'(\mubar) + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu}\right]\frac{\partial \mu'(s')}{\partial p_s}
\end{equation} Here $1_{s,s'}$ is $1$ if $s = s'$ and zero otherwise.  Differentiating equation \eqref{eq.lin_mart} with respect to $p_s$ we obtain
\[
	0 = \Pi_s\mubar - \Pi_s\mubar + \sum_{s'} \Pi_{s'}\pbar_s\frac{\partial \mu'(s')}{\partial p_s} =  \sum_{s'} \Pi_{s'}\pbar_s\frac{\partial \mu'(s')}{\partial p_s}
\]  Again we can combine these two equations to give us
\[
	\frac{\EE\pbar^2}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial p_s} + \frac{\Pi_s\bbar}{\beta}(\pbar_s-\EE\pbar^2) = 0
\] or
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial b}{\partial p_s} = \Pi_s\bbar \frac{\EE\pbar^2-\pbar_s}{\EE\pbar^2}
\end{equation}Going back to equation \eqref{eq.dimp_dps} we have
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\partial \mu'(s')}{\partial p_s} = \frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I '(\mubar) + \frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu}\right]}\left(1_{s,s'}-\frac{\Pi_s\pbar_s\pbar_{s'}}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)
\end{equation}
\subsection{Ergodic Distribution of the Linearized System}
The linearized system for $\mu$ now follows
\[
	\hat \mu_{t+1} = B \hat\mu_t + C
\]  where $B$ and $C$ are both random with means $\barB$ and $\barC$, and variances $\sigma_B^2$ and $\sigma_C^2$ .  Suppose that $\hat\mu$ is distributed according to the ergodic distribution of this linear system with mean $\EE\hat\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2_\mu$.  Since
\[
	B\hat\mu +C
\]has the same distribution we can compute the mean of this distribution as
\[
\begin{split}
	\EE\hat\mu &= \EE\left[ B\hat\mu+C\right]\\
			  &= \EE\left[\EE_{\hat\mu}\left[B\hat\mu+C\right]\right]\\
			  &= \EE\left[\barB\hat\mu +\barC\right]\\
			  &=\barB\EE\hat\mu+\barC
\end{split}
\]solving for $\EE\hat\mu$ we get
\begin{equation}
	\EE\hat\mu = \frac{\barC}{1-\barB}
\end{equation}For the variance $\sigma^2_{\hat\mu}$ we know that
\[
	\sigma^2_{\hat\mu} = \var(B\hat\mu+C) = \var(B\hat\mu) + \sigma_C^2 + 2\cov(B\hat\mu,C)
\]Computing the variance of $B\hat \mu$ we have
\[
\begin{split}
	\var(B\hat\mu) &=\EE\left[(B\hat\mu - \barB\EE\hat\mu)^2\right]\\
			       &=\EE\left[(B\hat\mu-\barB\hat\mu +\barB\hat\mu -\barB\EE\hat\mu)^2\right]\\
			      &=\EE\left[\EE_{\hat\mu}\left[(B-\barB)^2\hat\mu^2 +2(B-\barB)(\hat\mu-\EE\hat\mu)\barB\EE\hat\mu + (\hat\mu-\EE\hat\mu)^2\bar B^2\right]\right]\\
			&=\EE\left[\sigma_B^2\hat\mu^2 +(\hat\mu-\EE\hat\mu)^2\barB\right]\\
			& = \sigma_B^2(\sigma_{\hat\mu}^2+(\EE\hat\mu)^2) + \sigma_{\hat\mu}^2\barB^2
\end{split}
\]while for the covariance of $B\hat\mu$ and $C$
\[
	\cov(B\hat\mu,C) = \sigma_{BC}\EE\hat\mu
\]Putting this all together we have
\begin{equation}
	\sigma_{\hat\mu}^2 = \frac{\sigma_B^2(\EE\hat\mu)^2 + \sigma_{BC}\EE\hat\mu + \sigma_C^2}{1-\barB^2-\sigma_B^2}
\end{equation}
\subsection{What is the best $\pbar$}
We want to study the properties of the ergodic distribution of an economy with payoff structure $ p_s$, normalized so that $\EE p = 1$.  The immediate question to ask is where we should linearize around?  The natural answer is to choose $\mubar$ so as to minimize
\[
\| p-\pbar(\mubar)\|^2 = \sum_{s'}\Pi_{s'}( p_{s'}-\pbar(\mubar)_{s'})^2.
\]That is to choose $\mubar$ so as to minimize the variance of the difference between $ p$ and the set of steady state payoffs.  We shall see how this is the ``best'' choice by another metric.  The first order condition for this linearization gives us
\[
	2\sum_{s'}\Pi_s'( p_{s'}-\pbar(\mubar)_{s'}) \pbar'(\mubar)_{s'} = 0
\]as noted before
\[
	\pbar(\mubar)_s =  1 -\frac{\beta}{\bbar(\mubar)}\left(g_s - \EE g\right)
\]thus
\[
	\pbar'(\mubar) \propto \pbar(\mubar)-1
\]Thus, we can see the the optimal choice of $\mubar$ is equivalent to choosing $\mubar$ such that
\begin{equation}
	\begin{split}
		0 &= \sum_{s'}\Pi_{s'}( p_{s'} - \pbar(\mubar)_{s'})(\pbar(\mubar)_{s'}-1)\\
		&= -\sum_{s'}\Pi_{s'}( p_{s'}-\pbar(\mubar)_{s'}) + \sum_{s'}\Pi_{s'}( p_{s'}-\pbar(\mubar)_{s'})\pbar(\mubar)_{s'}\\
		&= \sum_{s'}\Pi_{s'}( p_{s'}-\pbar(\mubar)_{s'})\pbar(\mubar)_{s'}\\
		&=\EE\left[( p-\pbar(\mubar))\pbar(\mubar)\right]
	\end{split}
\end{equation}  Using this $\pbar$ and $\mubar$ we have that $C$ for our linearized system is
\[
	C_{s'} = \sum_s\left\{\frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(1_{s,s'}-\frac{\Pi_s \pbar_s\pbar_{s'}}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)({p}_s-\pbar_s) \right\}
\]Taking expectations we have that
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
	\barC &= \sum_s\left\{\frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(\Pi_s - \frac{\Pi_s\pbar_s}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)( p_s-\pbar_s)\right\}\\
	&=\frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(\EE( p-\pbar) -\frac{\EE\left[( p-\pbar)\pbar\right]}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)\\
	&= 0
\end{split}
\end{equation}  Thus, the linearized system will have the same mean for $\mu$, $\mubar$, as the closest approximating steady state payoff structure.

We can also compute the variance of the ergodic distribution for $\mu$.  Note
\[
\begin{split}
	C_{s'} &= \sum_s\left\{\frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left(1_{s,s'}-\frac{\Pi_s \pbar_s\pbar_{s'}}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)({p}_s-\pbar_s) \right\}\\
		 &=\frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}\left( p_{s'}-\pbar_{s'} -\pbar_{s'}\frac{\sum_s\Pi_s\pbar_s( p_s-\pbar_s)}{\EE\pbar^2}\right)\\
		&= \frac{\bbar}{\beta\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]}( p_{s'}-\pbar_{s})
\end{split}
\]  As noted before
\[
	\sigma_{\mu}^2 = \frac{\bbar^2}{\beta^2\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]^2\left(1-\barB^2-\sigma_B^2\right)}\| p-\pbar\|^2
\]  The variance of government debt in the linearized system is
\[
	\sigma_b^2 = \frac{\bbar^2\left(\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right)^2}{\beta^2\left[I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu}\right]^2\left(1-\barB^2-\sigma_B^2\right)}\| p-\pbar\|^2
\]  This can be simplified using the following expressions:
\[
	I'(\mubar)+\frac{\partial b}{\partial \mu} = \frac{\EE\pbar^2}{\beta}\frac{\partial b}{\partial\mu},
\]
\[
	\barB = \frac{1}{\EE\pbar^2}
\]and
\[
	\sigma_B^2 = \frac{\var(\pbar)}{(\EE\pbar^2)^2}
\] to
\begin{equation}
	\sigma^2_b = \frac{\bbar^2}{\EE\pbar^2\var(\pbar)}\|p-\pbar\|^2
\end{equation}Noting that $\EE\pbar^2 = 1 +\var(\pbar) > 1$, we have immediately that up to first order the relative spread of debt is bounded by
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\sigma_b}{\bbar} \leq \sqrt\frac{\|p-\pbar\|^2}{\var(\pbar)}
\end{equation}  Thus, as $p$ approaches a the steady state payoff vector the ergodic distribution becomes degenerate.
\end{proof}


{\textbf{Theorem 3}}

\begin{proof}

Suppose the unproductive agent has CRRA utility function with risk aversion $\sigma$. Under these assumption we can formulate the Bellman equation that solves for the Ramsey plan as follows:


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-QLRA obj}
    V(b\_,\rho\_)=\max_{c_1(s),c_2(s),\rho(s), b(s)} \sum_{s}\pi(s)\left\{\omega \left[u(c_1(s),l_1(s))\right]+(1-\omega )\left[\frac{c_2(s)^{1-\sigma}}{1-\sigma}\right]+\beta V(b(s),\rho(s)) \right\}
\end{equation}
subject to

   \begin{subequations}
   \label{sys- QLRA constraint}
    \begin{equation}
    \label{eq-implementability constraint}
    c_1(s)-c_2(s)+b(s)=l(s)^{1+\gamma}+\beta^{-1} b\_
    \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   \label{eq-ee}
\mathbb{E}c_2^{-\sigma}(s)=\rho\_
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
   \label{eq-definition rho}
   \rho(s)=c_2^{-\sigma}(s)
\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
  \label{eq-resoruces}
    n c_1(s)+(1-n)c_2(s)+g(s)\leq\theta_2 n l(s)
\end{equation}


   \end{subequations}

Let $\mu(s)\pi(s),\lambda\_,\kappa(s)\pi(s),\phi(s)\pi(s)$ be the Lagrange multipliers on the respective constraints. The FOC and the envelope conditions are summarized below


\begin{subequations}
   \label{sys-FOC QLRA}
   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq- foc c1 QLRA}
    \phi(s)=\omega-\frac{\mu(s)}{n}
   \end{equation}

   \begin{equation}
   \label{eq-foc c_2 QLRA}
   c_2(s)^{1-\sigma}=\frac{\phi(s)-\omega }{1-\omega}-\sigma c_2(s)^{-\sigma-1}\left(\lambda\_ \pi(s)+\beta\lambda[s]\right)
   \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
\label{eq-foc l_1 QLRA}
   \mu(s)= \frac{\omega\left[\frac{\theta}{l^{\gamma}(s)}-1\right]  }{\left[\frac{\theta}{l^{\gamma}(s)}-1-\gamma\right]}
    \end{equation}

    \begin{equation}
\label{eq-foc b(s) QLRA}
   \mu\_=\mathbb{E}\mu(s)
    \end{equation}
 \end{subequations}

We begin with some useful lemmas
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem-convergence mu}
The multiplier on the implementability constraint \eqref{eq-implementability constraint} $\mu_t\to\mu^*$ a.s
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Notice that the labor choice of the productive household implies $\frac{1}{1-\tau}=\frac{\theta_2}{l^{\gamma}(s)}$.

As taxes go to $-\infty$ \eqref{eq-foc l_1 QLRA} implies that $\mu(s)$ approaches $\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}$ from below. This provides us an upper bound .
\[\mu(s)\leq  \frac{\omega }{(1+\gamma)}\].
Applying the standard martingale convergence theorems we get the result
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
There exists  a $\overline{b}$ such that $b_t\leq\overline{b}_n$. This is the natural debt limit for the government.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
As we drive $\mu$ to $-\infty$, the tax rate approaches a maximum limit, $\bar{\tau}=\frac{\omega \gamma}{1+\gamma}$. Further transfers are bounded below by zero. Applying the same steps in Lemma \ref{lem-natural debt limit} we get the natural debt limit for the government.
\end{proof}



\begin{lemma}
\label{lem-slack EE}
\[\lim_t \lambda_t=0\]
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Equations \eqref{eq-ee} and \eqref{eq-definition rho} imply that $E\rho_{t+1}=\rho_t$ and the Inada conditions provide us a lower bound on $\rho_t$. Thus, again applying the Martingale convergence theorem we have $\rho_t\to \rho^*$ almost surely. This also implies that $E (\rho_{+1}-\rho_t)\to 0$. Thus asymptotically \eqref{eq-ee} is slack and the multiplier $\lim_t\lambda_t=0$.
 \end{proof}

 \noindent Now we can prove the main theorem,


Under the normalization in the theorem we have $c_t=T_t$ and $-B_t=b_t$ is the government debt.

Lemma \ref{lem-slack EE} shows $\lim_t\lambda_t=0$. Now we verify the first order constraints along with feasibility of the resulting allocation. By Lemma \ref{lem-convergence mu}, $\mu_t$ and $\phi_t$ converge to $\mu^*$ and $\phi^*$ respectively. Note that \eqref{eq-foc c_2 QLRA} implies that $\phi^*\geq \omega$. This provides us with another bound on $\mu^*$.
\[\mu^*\leq  \min \left \{\frac{\omega }{(1+\gamma)},(1-n)\omega \right\}\].
We first show that $\mu^*= \min\{(1-n)\omega,\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}\}$. Suppose $\mu^*$ is strictly lower than the bound. Then we have that  $c_{2,t}$ converges to a finite positive number $c_2^*$ and $\lim_tc_{1,t}=\frac{n\theta l^*-g(s_t)-(1-n)c_2^*}{n}$.The implementability constraint \eqref{eq-implementability constraint} further implies that $\lim_tb_t$ has to diverge. Suppose $\lim_tb_t=\infty$, this yields a contradiction as the maximum revenue the government can collect is finite in this economy. On the other hand if $\lim_tb_t=-\infty$, we will violate the productive agent's natural debt limit. This is because $\tau^*>-\infty$ and $T^*<\infty$ and hence his post tax income is bounded. \footnote{Since we do not impose  non-negativity constraint on his consumption, in prnciple he could sustain arbitrary debt with arbitrary negative consumption, but under the current guess $\min{c_t}>-\infty$.}

Now we have two cases to consider for $\mu^*$. Suppose $\mu^*=(1-n)\omega$. This implies $\phi^*=\omega$ and $c_2^*=\infty$. This makes limiting transfers,$T^*$ diverge to infinity and we can construct a solution where $\lim_tb_t=-\infty$. However tax rates will be bounded and given by
\[\tau^*=\frac{-\gamma (1-n)}{1-(1+\gamma)(1+n)}\]
\footnote{Under this solution $c_{1,t}$ diverges to $-\infty$ and we do not violate any natural debt limits for the productive agent.}

Lastly if $\mu^*=\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}$, $\tau^*\to -\infty$. In this case, we have $c_2^*$ finite and again the government debt $b_t$ diverges to $-\infty$. The transfers are given by the following expression,
\[T^*=\left(\frac{\omega(1-n)-\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}}{n(1-\omega)}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\sigma}}\]

Which of this case characterizes the solution depends on $n$ relative to $\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$ and is independent of $\omega$. As $n\to 0$ we have $\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}<\omega$ and conversely when $n \to 1$, we have $\omega(1-n)<\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}$

\end{proof}

 Suppose $P(s)=1\end{lemma}




\begin{theorem}
 Suppose $P(s)=1$ and we have an lower bound on debt $\underline{b}>-\infty$. For $n<1$ there is an invariant distribution $\psi .$ Morever, for any $\hat{b}\in \left( \underline{b},\bar{b}_n\right) ,$ $\psi \left( \left[ \underline{b},\hat{b}%
\right] \right) >0$ and $\psi \left( \left[ \hat{b},\bar{b}_n\right] \right)$.

If $n>\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$, there exists a $\underline{\tau}$ independent of $\underline{b}$ such that
 \begin{itemize}
  \item $\tau_t\geq\underline{\tau}>-\infty$, and
  \item As $\underline{b} =-\infty$, we have $\tau_t\to \underline{ \tau}$ a.s
 \end{itemize}

 \end{theorem}



\begin{proof}
Consider the case when $\underline{b}=-\infty$.   Lemma \ref{lem-bounds on multipliers} gives us bounds on $\mu_t$. The super-martingale converge theorem implies $\lim_t\mu_t=\mu^*$. First we show that $b_t\to-\infty$

\[\mu^* \leq \min \left \{\frac{\omega (1-n)}{n},\frac{\omega }{(1+\gamma)} \right\}\]

Suppose not. As $\mu_t\to \mu^*$. Thus taxes, labor supply and output converges to a constant.

If $n<\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$, $\mu_t\to\frac{\omega}{1+\gamma}$. In this case taxes diverge to $-\infty$. Also$\phi_t\to \phi^*=\frac{\omega \gamma}{n(1+\gamma)} >\omega$. Thus  $T_t \to T^*<\infty$ and The fluctuations $g(s)$ are absorbed by $c_1(s)$. With sufficient stochasticity of $g(s)$, the implementability constraint implies that $b_t$ will violate any bounds.

Now if $n>\frac{\gamma}{1+\gamma}$, the multiplier $\mu_t$ converges to $\frac{\omega (1-n)}{n}$. The limiting taxes $\underline{\tau} $ can be obtained from the FOC \eqref{eq-foc l_1 QLRA}. In this case $


T_t\to \infty$ and $c_{1,t}\to-\infty$.

\end{proof}
