In the theorem \ref{thm heterogeneous agents} two-types economy,
% using fluctuations in transfers to hedge aggregate shocks imposes utility costs on the zero skilled ($\theta_{2,t} =0$)
% type 2 agents. The Ramsey planner balances these costs against the efficiency costs associated with fluctuations in the tax rate on labor.  How the planner
% strikes this balance depends on the Pareto weight $\omega$ attached to the higher skilled type $1$ agent.  For sufficiently high $\omega$, the planner opts for productive
% efficiency
a Ramsey planner faces  costs of using  fluctuating transfers to hedge aggregate shocks.
The  environment is simple enough to allow us to pinpoint how these costs depend on the Pareto weights.
