< (2) the observation  that  in recessions the left tail of the cross-section distribution of labor income falls by more than right tail; and (3) how inflation and asset return risk comove with labor productivity. We use this model to validate and quantify the importance of the different channels that were emphasized in our theoretical analysis with simpler environments. Besides this we also describe features of optimal government policy, especially in booms and recessions at higher frequencies. We find that during recessions accompanied by higher inequality, it is  optimal to increase taxes and transfers and to issue

This allowed us to study transition paths of the optimal allocation while recognizing that the joint distribution of individual wealths and past consumptions, a high dimension endogenous state variable, is important for capturing the dynamics.
